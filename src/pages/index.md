Engineer your own personalized longevity playbook and forever change the way you think about health. {% .lead %}

Longevity is the goal, which is the balance between lifespan (living longer) and healthspan (living better).
Increasing lifespan boils down to delaying the inevitability of death.
The four most common disease processes that end life are:

- Atherosclerotic disease (comprised of cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease)
- Cancer
- Neurodegenerative disease (Alzheimer’s disease being the most common) 
- “Foundational disease” - a spectrum of everything from hyperinsulinemia to insulin resistance to fatty liver disease to type 2 diabetes.
 
Enhancing healthspan boils down to avoiding three categories of decline:

1. Cognitive decline—decline in executive function, processing speed, and memory; Alzheimer’s disease is an extreme version of this decline, but many far less severe forms of this decline are pervasive.
2. Physical decline—decline in stability, flexibility, mobility, strength, muscle mass, bone density, aerobic function, anaerobic function, functional movement, freedom from pain, and sexual function.
3. Emotional decline—decline in mindfulness, social support, sense of purpose, fulfillment, and relationality.
