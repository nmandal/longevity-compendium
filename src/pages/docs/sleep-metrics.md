description: Metrics to track sleep
---

The four pillars of good sleep are depth, duration, continuity, and regularity

```
Time to sleep
Wake up time
Time asleep
Time awake
Resting heart rate
Heart rate variability
Sleep efficiency
Restfulness
Body temperature
Respiratory rate
Deep sleep
REM sleep
```

Depth/quality: deep sleep and ossilations

Duration: getting enough time of sleep

Continuity: minimizing wake-ups and fragmentation

Regularity: Going to bed and waking up at the same time each day.

Oura

```
Total Sleep: “Did you get enough sleep?”
Efficiency: “How much of your time in bed did you actually spend sleeping?”
Restfulness: “Did you toss and turn?”
REM Sleep: “Did you get enough REM sleep?”
Deep Sleep: “Did you get enough deep sleep?”
Latency: “How quickly did you fall asleep?”
Timing: “When are you getting to sleep? Are you going to bed according to your body’s natural circadian rhythm?”
```
