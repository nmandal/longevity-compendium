The four pillars of good sleep are depth, duration, continuity, and regularity

## Metrics the EARLY platform collects from Oura

- Date
- Bedtime: an estimate of the time you went to bed with the intention to sleep.
- Wake Up Time: the time you got out of bed.
- Total Sleep Duration: the total amount of time you spend in light, REM and deep sleep.
- Awake Time: the time spent awake in bed before and after falling asleep.
- REM Sleep Duration: REM (rapid eye movement) sleep is the final sleep stage in a typical sleep cycle. It’s associated with dreaming, memory consolidation, learning and creativity.
- Deep Sleep Duration: Deep sleep is the most restorative and rejuvenating sleep stage, enabling muscle growth and repair.
- Sleep Efficiency: the percentage of time you actually spend asleep after going to bed.
- Sleep Latency: the time it takes for you to fall asleep.
- Lowest Resting Heart Rate: Lowest point of resting heart rate while asleep.
- Average Resting Heart Rate: Average resting heart rate while asleep
- Average Heart Rate Variability: Oura calculates your night-time HRV from the rMSSD, a well-known HRV parameter that provides a good view on your Autonomic Nervous System activity.
- Temperature Deviation (°C): Variations in temperature from normal baseline.
- Respiratory Rate: the average number of breaths you take per minute while you sleep.
- Inactive Time: time spent sitting, standing or otherwise being passive.
- Average MET: the daily average MET for when you are awake.
