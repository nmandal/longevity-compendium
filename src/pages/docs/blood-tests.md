# Overview of bloodwork

The blood carries a lot of intel and this intel can help gauge the wellness of your entire body, detect disease, vitamin deficiencies, and so much more. All molecules travel through the blood, and either stay in the body or leave via urine or stool. For example, when you eat, minerals and nutrients break down, filter through the liver or kidneys, and are then transported in the blood to organs, cells, and the tiniest crevices. If your body rules the molecule is waste, it is excreted.

Like blood, urine carries a wealth of knowledge. Once waste and extra fluid filter through the kidneys, it leaves your body via urine. Urinalysis measures color and appearance, chemical levels, and microscopic findings that, like blood, can monitor or detect disease, illness, or other important information about your body.

Bloodwork and urinalysis measure biomarkers (biological markers). The results of each biomarker can help understand the body’s mechanisms, the presence of disease or illness, and the general state of your nutrition. There are hundreds of biomarkers with each one carrying its own information. Below are a few examples of the types of biomarkers and their related functions revealed through bloodwork and urinalysis.

- Nutrition: vitamins, minerals
- Inflammation: toxins, bacteria, proteins
- Organ health: enzymes
- Endocrine: hormones, reproductive
- Immunity: white blood cells
- Hematology: red blood cells
- Heart: cholesterol, triglycerides, lipid size and density
- Autoimmune: antibodies
- Allergens: foods, trees, grass, pollen
- Infectious disease: Lyme, STDs

## Nutrients

### Methylmalonic Acid (MMA)

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| 87-318 nmol/L   |

This test evaluates your methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels, but the purpose is to check on your vitamin B, which can be measured here due to their dynamic relationship.

Here’s how it works: When the body digests proteins, it produces tiny amounts of MMA, which is a key component for metabolism and energy. MMA starts off wanting to be converted into succinyl-CoA, a compound that helps with energy production. In order to make a conversation like this work, it requires a cofactor (a facilitator). In this case, that cofactor is vitamin B12. If there isn’t enough B12 in your system, the conversion doesn’t happen effectively.

MMA then joins forces with coenzyme A, a molecule that produces energy in the powerhouse of cells: the mighty mitochondria. When the body has adequate B12, all goes well and MMA levels stay in a healthy range. If B12 is deficient, however, MMA levels become abnormal. This rings the alarm that the body needs more B12.

If your results show above-average MMA levels, it may mean the conversion isn’t happening because you are B12 deficient. So, why aren’t we testing your B12 instead of MMA? Because the MMA test is more sensitive than a B12 test and gives you closer insight into your B12 levels, especially if a deficiency is mild or just beginning.

**Benefits of MMA and B12**

A well-balanced MMA and B12 helps your central nervous system work efficiently, so checking in on this duo is important because a long-term deficiency can lead to pernicious anemia, a type of anemia caused by malabsorption of vitamin B12. Those who follow a vegan diet are prone to B12 deficiency because B12 is not substantially available in plant sources. Elderly people are also vulnerable due to inadequate stomach acid, which helps the body absorb vitamins. This important absorption function naturally decreases with age. Low absorption also occurs if you’re taking proton pump inhibitors (PPI, or acid blocker drugs), which are common over-the-counter medications.

The benefits of Vitamin B12 are vast, but to understand its significance, here are just a few:

- Brain: B is for “brain booster”! Bs help neurotransmitters in the brain communicate with the body. B12 vitamins work with Vitamin B6 and folate (B9) to fuel neurons that improve and jog memory.
- Mood: B12 helps synthesize serotonin, which is a mood booster. If deficient you may experience anxiousness, feelings of depression, or irritability.
- Skin, hair, and nails: Its role in cell production gives nails, skin, and hair the ability to keep growing and growing _stronger._
- Heart health: Creates a healthy balance of homocysteine, which can impact your heart if overproduced.
- Red blood cell production: By helping produce red blood cells, B12 gives you the energy to thrive. Red blood cells are constantly being used and made. Blood builders like B12 are important for your overall health and energy.

MMA should ideally be less than 250. If greater than 300, your levels are significant enough to indicate a vitamin B12 deficiency. Symptoms of B12 deficiency may include grogginess, lack of motivation, anxiety, depression, impaired detoxification in the liver, tingling in the hands and feet, brain fog, and much more. You may relate the feeling of B12 deficiency as “feeling off.”

### Omega-3 and Omega-6

#### Omega 3 (EPA + DHA)

| Optimal range | Reference range |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| >3.2%         | 1.4-49%         |

#### Omega 6 / Omega 3 ratio

| Optimal range | Reference range |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 2 or less     | 5.7-21.3        |

Omega-3 and omega-6 are essential fatty acids (EFAs): the building blocks for every cell in your body. Well-balanced omega-3 and 6 fatty acids can empower brain and mental health (the brain is made of 60% fat!), nerve function, and promote a healthy heart, circulation, immune system, gastrointestinal tract, skin, hair, and nails. Proper balance is also vital for all pregnant women and their babies since the developing brain and nervous system require large amounts of EFAs that must come from the mother.

An imbalance, specifically more omega-6 than 3s, can cause inflammation, which might cause bone and muscle aches, lead to an unruly digestive tract, and impact the systems that help you thrive and feel good, both mentally and physically.

Let’s break this down:

**Omega-3 fatty acids** are anti-inflammatory fats found in some nuts, seeds, oils, and fish. You probably know them as “the good fats.” Omega-3 fatty acids not only “cool off” inflammation, but also reduce the risk of inflammation starting in the first place. These fats help create thyroid hormones, which support your metabolism and affect your body's temperature, heart rate, and how well you burn calories. If you don't have enough thyroid hormones, your body processes slow down and you’ll feel it! Low omega-3 might make you feel weak, fatigued, sluggish, and moody (feelings of depression, irritability, or anxiety).

**Omega-6 fatty acids** are essential to good health, but according to Dr. Hyman, too much of the _bad_ omega-6 fatty acids can trigger inflammation and counteract the benefits and availability of omega-3 fats. The Standard American Diet (whose acronym is rightly “SAD”) usually has 14-25 times more omega-6 fatty acids than omega-3 fatty acids. This isn’t good. Too much omega-6 reduces the conversion of plant-based omega-3 fatty acids (called alpha-linolenic acid, or ALA) into active forms of omega-3 (called eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid or EPA and DHA, respectively) by about 40%.

**Looking at your results**

For omegas, you’re comparing omega-3 versus omega-6, with an aim of a low omega-6/3 ratio.

First, look at the risk and whether you’re in the high, moderate, or low range. Then the ratio and EPA level. Here’s a breakdown of the key numbers:

Omega 3 (EPA + DHA) Risk

- High (<2.2%)
- Moderate (2.2%-3.2%)
- Low (>3.2%)

Omega 6/3 ratio

- 2:1 or less (i.e. 1:1, 2:1) is optimal. Anything over 4:1 is out of range, indicating too many omega-6.
- If your risk level falls under “moderate” and you are out of range for the omega-6/3 ratio, consider reducing foods with omega-6 to regain a healthier balance.

### Zinc

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| 60-130 mcg/dL   |

Zinc is a champion of the body’s support system! It’s a powerful mineral used for cell growth and repair, enzyme activation, strengthening bones and muscles, transporting oxygen throughout the body, empowering the immune system to fight off infections, metabolizing proteins, fats, and carbs, and healing wounds. Wait, we’re not done yet. It also aids in reproduction, growth, taste, vision, and smell, preventing blood clotting and metal accumulation, and promoting proper insulin and thyroid function.

While your body relies on zinc for so many functions, it doesn’t produce it on its own, so it’s important to incorporate zinc-rich foods into your diet, like animal proteins, shellfish, nuts, and legumes, to name a few. If you’re a vegetarian or vegan, zinc can be hard to get from food alone, so some people often turn to zinc supplements to make sure they’re properly equipped with this superpower mineral. Zinc deficiency can be the culprit of thinning hair in women, sexual dysfunction, and low mood.

Due to inadequate dietary intake and absorption of zinc, deficiency is quite common in the developing world. Even in the United States, about 12% of the population and as many as 40% of the elderly are at risk for zinc deficiency.

### Vitamin D

| Optimal range | Reference range |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 40 - 75 ng/mL | 30-100 ng/mL    |

Vitamin D is an absolute powerhouse vitamin. Your body makes vitamin D when direct sunlight converts a chemical in your skin into an active form of the vitamin. While vitamin D isn't naturally found in a lot of foods, you _can_ get it from fortified foods and fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines.

The role of vitamin D is vast and is an incredibly important piece to the intricate puzzle of the body.

- **Immune system:** fights off invading bacteria and viruses, and helps the immune system self-monitor, which decreases the risk of autoimmune onset and progression.
- **Thyroid:** helps the T3 thyroid hormone bind to receptors on a nucleus that controls gene function and our overall metabolism.
- **Bones and teeth:** helps the body absorb calcium and phosphorus from the diet.
- **Muscles:** aids in muscle growth and strength.
- **Brain:** allows nerves in the brain to communicate to the rest of the body.

Vitamin D deficiency affects over 40% of Americans and is most common in cold northern climates where people are cloaked in warm clothes leaving their skin covered from the sun. Other risk factors include obesity and gut issues that cause malabsorption. People of color may have increased melanin in their skin that can act as a “shield” and reduce the synthesis of vitamin D from the sun.

Vitamin D deficiency is widely underdiagnosed and undertreated. Over time, low levels can lead to hypothyroidism (since T3 needs vitamin D to bind), osteoporosis, cancer, heart disease, fatigue, depression, seasonal affective disorder (SAD), and fibromyalgia.

### Homocysteine

| Optimal range | Reference range |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 6 - 8 umol/L  | <11.4 umol/L    |

This homocysteine test can illuminate your body’s vitamin B levels and your methylation function. Homocysteine is an amino acid important for the gut, hair, nails, skin, and joints. Amino acids build the proteins used to create and regenerate tissues throughout the body. This is how your body builds and rebuilds, grows and regrows.

Think of homocysteine as an operator choreographing the exchange of information across a wide web of telephone lines. For your body, if this system breaks down, you will feel it with fatigue, weakness in your body, skin, hair, and nails, and/or shifts in your mood (irritability, feelings of anxiety or depression, loss of motivation). When homocysteine is mildly elevated, it can contribute to fatigue, slower cognitive processing, detox impairment through the liver, and slower cellular turnover.

**What is methylation?**

You may have seen or heard of B vitamins that are methylated. Why is this important? Well, methylation is a profound biochemical process that helps regulate your homocysteine levels. Before homocysteine does its tasks around the body, it is converted to necessary compounds like methionine and cysteine with the assistance of cofactor molecules vitamin B12, folate (B9), and B6. Ideal levels of homocysteine fall between 6 and 8 umol/L, and it’s incredibly important to keep your levels healthy because this promotes methylation.

B vitamins drive the methylation process, and without them, your homocysteine can build up and increase the risk of blood clots, dementia, heart disease, heart attack, osteoporosis, and stroke. The opposite is true as well, meaning low levels of B vitamins can lead to high levels of homocysteine.

### Iron

| Optimal range   | Reference range |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| 27 - 159 mcg/dL | 50 - 180 mcg/dL |

Iron is a mineral that helps various vital functions in the body: providing energy and focus, building a strong gastrointestinal tract and immune system, and regulating body temperature. You might not notice the wonderful benefits of iron until you’re not getting enough of it. For instance, you might be having a wonderful month, then all of a sudden you notice a week has gone by where you’ve felt cold, your brain is foggy and mood is off, and you’re downright sluggish. That’s what iron deficiency can feel like.

Your body uses iron to make hemoglobin. If you don’t have enough hemoglobin, your oxygen carrying capacity will be reduced, depleting your energy and metabolism. Your body’s processes will be as sluggish as you feel. On the other hand, too much iron can be toxic to the body. Iron blood levels and iron storage increase when more iron is absorbed than the body needs. Absorbing too much iron can lead to progressive accumulation and damage to the liver, heart, pancreas and other organs.

### Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC)

| Optimal range    | Reference range  |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 250 - 450 mcg/dL | 250 - 425 mcg/dL |

Along with your iron and ferritin tests, your total iron binding capacity (TIBC) assesses your body’s ability to transport iron in the blood. The test also helps diagnose and/or monitor iron-deficiency or iron overload. If you have iron deficiency, your iron level will be low but your TIBC will be high.

TIBC also indirectly measures transferrin. Think of it like this: transferrin puts the “transfer” in transferring iron. Simply put, it transfers iron through your blood to various tissues, such as the liver, spleen, and bone marrow.

### Ferritin

| Optimal range         | Reference range |
| --------------------- | --------------- |
| Male: 100 - 300 ng/mL | 38-380 ng/mL    |

Ferritin is a protein that stores iron in cells then releases the iron when your body makes more red blood cells. The ferritin then binds to another substance called transferrin, which transports the iron through the blood to various tissues such as the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Levels will be low when there is an iron deficiency and high when there is an excess of iron in the body or there is an acute inflammatory stimulus.

### Calcium

| Optimal range    | Reference range  |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 8.5 - 10.2 mg/dL | 8.6 - 10.3 mg/dL |

Calcium is a mineral your body uses to build and maintain strong bones and teeth. In fact, 98-99% of calcium stores remain in those areas. Physical functions, such as muscle control and blood circulation, are also dependent on calcium.

Most of the calcium in the blood is in its “free form,” which means it can move across tissues and cells easily. The remaining is bound to other compounds, including albumin. This connection helps explain why abnormalities in calcium occur when albumin is low. Calcium absorption through digestion is dependent on the stomach maintaining a low pH (acid) and also requires phosphorus and magnesium to do their job of helping protein and fat absorption.

Calcium levels are typically highly regulated by your body, so when levels do fluctuate abnormally, it is a loud signal that something is off. According to the University of Rochester, calcium levels that are too low (hypocalcemia) or too high (hypercalcemia) may indicate a number of problems, even if you are asymptomatic. Possible causes of abnormal calcium levels include malnourishment, low or high vitamin D, dysfunction of the parathyroid gland, kidney disease, pancreatitis, and cancer.

Your body does not make calcium on its own, so it’s important for you to incorporate calcium-rich foods into your diet regularly. To effectively absorb calcium from food, your body also needs vitamin D. Over time, if you aren’t absorbing enough calcium from your diet, your body takes it from your bones where it is being stored. This is why abnormal levels are a serious problem. This weakens the bones and may lead to osteoporosis, a disorder in which bones become very fragile.

As a side note: Contrary to popular belief, while dairy contains calcium, drinking milk won’t raise blood levels of calcium if you are low. Your body regulates calcium so well on its own, that if your levels show up abnormal, drinking milk won’t solve the problem.

### Magnesium

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| 4.0 - 6.4 mg/dL |

Magnesium is the ultimate relaxation mineral. It helps with more than 600 enzyme reactions and is found in all of your tissues—but appears in its greatest quantities in your bones, muscles, and brain. When something feels tight, crampy, stiff (mood, included), you might be deficient, and a bit of magnesium gives you the feeling of the calm after a storm.

This mineral is imperative for cells to make energy, for chemical pumps to work and stabilize membranes, and to help muscles relax. So, when you’re low on magnesium you may feel overstimulated, jumpy, and a bit wired.

You get magnesium naturally in many foods, but a lot of habits hinder magnesium’s job, like using too much salt, drinking alcohol, or consuming morning, afternoon, AND evening caffeinated drinks. Think. If magnesium tames the beast, those awaken it! Sometimes, though, other things contribute to slowing down the processes with which magnesium helps, like sweating, prolonged or intense stress, chronic diarrhea, heavy and painful menstruation, diuretics (water pills), antibiotics and other drugs, and some intestinal parasites.

This is all further complicated by the fact that magnesium is often poorly absorbed and easily lost from our bodies. To properly absorb magnesium we need a lot of it in our diet, plus enough vitamin B6, vitamin D, and selenium to get the job done. Low levels might mean you don’t get enough magnesium in your diet and need to take extra. Or, your body might get rid of more magnesium than you should.

Because of its importance, the list of conditions related to magnesium deficiency is very long. In fact, there are over 3,500 medical references on magnesium deficiency! If you ever become magnesium deficient, you may experience symptoms that feel like your body is overactive or erratic, and because of that your body might also feel exhausted and overworked:

- Muscle cramps or twitches
- Insomnia
- Irritability
- Sensitivity to loud noises
- Palpitations
- Constipation
- Anal spasms
- Headaches
- Migraines
- Chronic fatigue
- PMS
- Menstrual cramps

Medical conditions

- Anxiety
- Autism
- ADD
- Angina
- Asthma
- Kidney stones
- Diabetes
- Obesity
- Osteoporosis
- High blood pressure
- Irritable bladder
- Irritable bowel syndrome
- Reflux
- Trouble swallowing
- Fibromyalgia
- Inflammation
- Higher C-reactive protein levels

This test gives you a glimpse into your magnesium levels.

## Detoxification

### Lead

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| <3.5 mcg/dL     |

The body naturally has lead in it because it’s a common element all around us. But it becomes dangerous if you’re exposed to large amounts from hazardous sources, like dust from lead-based paint (the most frequent cause of lead poisoning), soil tainted by leaded gasoline, tap water in homes with lead pipes, and paint/dust chips from old toys and furniture. Most homes built before 1978 used lead paint, so if this relates to you, proceed carefully with renovations or housework. Exposure to high amounts of lead can be extremely poisonous and harmful to almost every organ in your body.

**How is lead absorbed?**

Through the respiratory and digestive tract. Hence contaminated water is a big problem. It is absorbed 5x more in children than adults, according to a Center of Disease Control (CDC) report on human exposure to environmental chemicals.

**Where is lead stored in the body?**

Bone and/or teeth: 95%

Blood: 2%

Soft tissues: 3%

Unfortunately, once lead is stored in bones, the release from bone to blood is tedious. Once it is in the blood, it is able to be filtered through the kidneys and excreted (primarily) through urine. Some, about 15%, is released through bowel movements, while the rest is through sweat, nails, and hair.

**What are symptoms?**

Acute:

- Nausea, vomiting
- Pain
- kidney failure
- convulsions

Chronic:

- Kidney disease, elevated creatinine, low estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)
- Cardiovascular issues: hypertension, heart disease (plaque formation)
- Endocrine disruption: unexplained infertility and pregnancy outcomes, developmental disorders
- Neurologic changes: brain fog, depression, risk for dementia
- Anemia
- Wrist drop

**Fertility Impact Note**

Fascinatingly, toxic levels of lead have been found in human male seminal fluids. This is the fluid that nourishes the sperm while it’s on the journey to try and fertilize an egg. Higher toxic metals in this fluid can lead to a higher risk of genetic mutations in the sperm, leading to non-viable pregnancy outcomes or postnatal concerns. Lead toxicity is of critical importance for the female partner as she may inadvertently expose her egg and later her fertilized embryo to lead if an ongoing exposure remains.

**Planning:** For couples planning a pregnancy, it is important to complete any detox chelation programs at least 90 days prior to conception. Toxicity can expose egg and sperm cells to these metals unintentionally. Remember, the vast majority of lead is stored in the bones, so it can be stable for a long time until accelerated bone turnover.

### Mercury

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| ≤10 mcg/L       |

Mercury is a heavy metal that can be found in both liquid and vapor forms. In the modern industrialized world, mercury is everywhere: from coal burning, industrialization, plastics, pesticides, PVC pipes, and more. Some fish (carnivores like tuna or swordfish) contain high levels of mercury. And smaller fish, like Atlantic and farmed salmon, also have measurable amounts of methylmercury.

Mercury is present in three different material states: organic, inorganic, and elemental. The following are the most common exposures for humans:

- Elemental mercury is released as gas in the environment through the breakdown of mercury compounds like coal and thermometers. It is absorbed in the lungs. Once in the bloodstream, it has free reign to get into the brain, placenta, and other tissues.
- Methyl mercury is primarily found in fish. Its half-life—the amount of time it takes the body to eliminate 50% of this material/compound—is two years (in fish, not humans) and mercury from big fish can accumulate quite a bit. Almost all the mercury in that form is absorbed through the human gastrointestinal tract. In humans, the half-life is 45-70 days and two-thirds of methylmercury is eliminated through bowel movements, the remaining one-third leaves through urine.
- Mercury amalgam fillings: conventional wisdom has taught us that the amount of mercury released from our mercury amalgam fillings is safe and does not contribute to human disease states. There is mounting data pointing to the adverse impact that low-dose chronic mercury amalgams have on human health. What does this mean? It means, that if you have amalgams and are concerned about chronic mercury exposure, this may be something to address with your dentist who can discuss your options for removal.

Comparing your mercury levels over time and establishing a baseline for yourself can help you better understand why and how you’re being exposed to mercury. Long-term exposure can be incredibly harmful to all systems in your body.

**What are the symptoms?**

Chronic exposure: poor memory, fatigue, headaches, depression, musculoskeletal concerns, high blood pressure, low thyroid, prediabetes, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, hair loss, fatty liver disease.

**Fertility Impact Note**

If family planning, you’ll want to check mercury levels ahead of time. Heavy metals can be passed through semen and have an impact on fertility outcomes in men and women. For a pregnant woman, mercury is especially dangerous for a fetus or a young child, as it can lead to brain and nervous system damage. Pregnant women (or women who may become pregnant), nursing mothers, and young children should avoid fish and shellfish with high levels of mercury. You can use the NRDC Mercury Wallet or look to [EWG](http://www.ewg.org) and [CleanFish](http://www.cleanfish.com) for guides to eating clean fish. It could often take a year for elevated mercury exposure to return to a safe level, so women who are planning on becoming pregnant should anticipate adjusting their diet ahead of time. A preconception detox food plan is a great place to start for fertility/preconception care.

## Digestive

### Amylase

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| 21-101 U/L      |

The amylase enzyme is produced in the salivary glands and pancreas. It’s a digestive protein that breaks down carbohydrates and starches into the simple sugars that allow for digestion to occur.  An abnormal level of amylase (either high or low) reveals potential issues with the pancreas or salivary glands. One common condition is pancreatitis, an inflammatory condition in the pancreas, which hinders the ability to create enzymes needed for healthy digestion.

Symptoms of acute pancreatitis include severe abdominal or back pain, fever, nausea and vomiting, and loss of appetite. Chronic pancreatitis is typically more subtle but still bothersome. Abdominal pain can be absent in some cases. An imbalance of amylase could indicate salivary disease, celiac disease, IBD, and the growth of a tumor in an amylase-producing tissue.

### Lipase

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| 7 - 60 U/L      |

When you eat, your pancreas releases the lipase enzyme into your digestive tract to help the intestines break down fats. This is in addition to bile that originates in the liver and is released from the gallbladder. This bile helps to emulsify fats in the small intestine. A stable level of lipase promotes healthy digestive and cell function.

If your pancreas is inflamed or injured, it releases more or less lipase than it normally would if it were healthy. People with cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), indigestion, and celiac disease may have abnormal lipase levels and experience fat malabsorption as a result. This means fat-soluble vitamins may be in short supply because of inadequate fat breakdown.

## Male Hormones

### Prostate specific antigen (PSA), Free

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| >25 %           |

The prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a protein produced by cells in the prostate, a small gland that surrounds the urethra and produces fluid for semen. PSA circulates through the body either bound to other proteins or as “free” PSA that is unbound and traveling alone. Measuring your PSA screens for tumors and/or monitors preexisting prostate cancer.

Free and Total PSA tests are used to determine whether a prostate biopsy is needed, or if the elevated level is due to a benign condition. However, on its own, it can not be used to diagnose cancer. Rather, this test acts as a signal if something is wrong. When free PSA levels are higher,  and if your total PSA is elevated, it is likely from benign enlargement of the prostate, called benign prostatic hyperplasia. For example, if the total PSA is 10.0 and free is 1.0, that would be more cause for concern. Whereas, if total PSA is 3 and free PSA is 1, it would be less concerning.

### Prostate specific antigen (PSA), Total

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| ≤ 4.0 ng/mL     |

The prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a protein produced by cells in the prostate, a small gland that surrounds the urethra and produces fluid that makes up semen. PSA circulates through the body either bound to other proteins or on its own. Free PSA travels alone, unbound to other proteins. Free and Total PSA tests are used to determine whether a biopsy is needed, or if the elevated level is due to a benign condition.

Measuring your PSA screens for tumors and/or monitors preexisting prostate cancer. However, on its own, it can not be used to diagnose cancer. Rather, this test and your free PSA reveals the health of your prostate and acts as a signal if something is wrong.

### Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)

| Reference range  |
| ---------------- |
| 1.6 - 8.0 mIU/mL |

Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) levels can give you some insight into your fertility, and the health of your testicles and pituitary function. FSH is partially responsible for sperm production and sexual development. In fact, for all intents and purposes, it is the first signal directly to the testes that begin the testosterone and sperm-producing process. Adequate levels are necessary for healthy male hormonal function.

FSH is made by your pituitary gland—a small gland located underneath the brain—that many call the “master gland” because it conducts other organs to release hormones. FSH is regulated by testosterone and inhibin, which are made in the testes. FSH works closely with your luteinizing hormone, both of which play a role in sexual development and sperm production. Levels should stay stable, but if your pituitary gland isn’t working properly, it won’t trigger the release of either FSH or LH. This can cause issues with sperm production and potentially lead to low testosterone.

Being under or overweight can impact FSH. Malnourishment from either not eating enough or eating unhealthy foods can deprive your hormones of the nutrients they need to metabolize and function. For instance, hormones are built from cholesterol and fats. If you lack good fats or have too many bad fats, then hormones won’t be nurtured with the things they need to grow and develop.

### Luteinizing Hormone (LH)

| Reference range  |
| ---------------- |
| 1.5 - 9.3 mIU/mL |

Luteinizing Hormone (LH) is produced by the pituitary gland—a small gland located underneath the brain—and plays an important role in sexual development and reproductive health. LH helps the testicles make testosterone, which is important for producing sperm and many other male functions. Normally, LH levels in men do not change very much, so testing LH can indicate a number of development and fertility-related disorders if levels are abnormal.

### Estradiol (E2)

| Optimal range | Reference range |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 10 - 39 pg/mL | ≤ 39 pg/mL      |

Estrogen receptors, as well as aromatase—the enzyme that converts testosterone to estrogen—are abundant in the brain, penis, testes, and other organs that are important for sexual function. While testosterone is the most significant hormone for male sexual development and function, estradiol (the most prominent form of estrogen) in men is essential for regulating libido, erectile function, and sperm production. It also helps with bone maintenance, brain function, and nitric oxide production, which is required to relax the muscles in the penis.

As men age, testosterone naturally decreases and estrogen increases, which is common unless your estrogen levels are abnormally high. Low testosterone and elevated estrogen (on their own) increase risk of erectile dysfunction.

High levels of estrogen are often caused by testosterone therapy, excess alcohol, a diet high in starch and sugar, and excess belly fat. Another driver is the presence of excessive insulin secretion from the pancreas. This is typically caused by insulin resistance from metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. When insulin is elevated, it can stimulate the enzyme aromatase that then increases conversion of testosterone to estradiol.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate (DHEA-S)

| Optimal range | Reference range |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| <200 mg/dL    | 93-415 mcg/dL   |

Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) is the most abundant hormone in the human body. It is associated with longevity, positive reproductive outcomes, and immune system regulation. DHEA-S production gradually increases from age 10, peaks during your 20s, and slowly decreases with age.

DHEA-S is one of three adrenal androgens produced in the adrenal gland. Androgens are steroid hormones that control the development and maintenance of masculine characteristics. The prominent androgen is testosterone.

This test can gauge reproductive function, but also the health of your adrenal gland. Adrenal glands are small, triangular-shaped glands located on top of both kidneys. They help you respond to stress but they also produce hormones that help regulate metabolism, immune system, blood pressure, and reproductive functions. These are some pretty important tasks. So, let’s say you are chronically stressed. Your adrenals will be constantly working to quell that stress, which can throw your adrenals off. You’ll feel this big time: you might be tired and wired at the same time, anxious and groggy, dizzy with heart palpitations. You might have low blood pressure. You might even have sugar cravings because your body can’t regulate your blood sugar properly.

When DHEA-S is released from the adrenal glands it enters the tissue of skin, fat, muscles, and brain, and is converted to androstenedione and testosterone. Some of these tissues can often double up their conversion by transforming androstenedione into a more potent testosterone. Some of this testosterone can go back into circulation, and in high concentrations, it can build up in major areas, such as hair follicles.

The upkeep of your adrenals can help you feel full of energy and just all-around balanced.

### Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| 10 - 50 nmol/L  |

Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is a protein primarily made in the liver. It binds tightly to the main sex hormones and guides them out of tissues and into the blood. Kind of like a bouncer at a club, SHBG patrols the number of sex hormones that your body tissues can use, which balances sex hormone-related processes, such as sperm production, libido, and testostosterone availability in the body. Hormones can’t enter cells when they are bound to something else, so the rate of hormones getting into their target cells greatly depends on how much SHBG the liver produces. SHBGs prioritize androgens (male hormones) and bind to the following in order of affinity:

- Dihydrotestosterone/DHT
- Testosterone
- Androstenediol
- Estradiol
- Estrone

SHBG is intended to balance out hormones so you don’t have too much or too little at one time. If you have a low SHBG it signifies your available sex hormones may have more activity on their target cells. Important to note: SHBG correlates inversely (the opposite) with the insulin hormone. Meaning, that higher levels of insulin—as seen in insulin resistance—correspond to lower levels of SHBG. So, the ON button for hormones listed above is high in insulin-resistant individuals. This is a critical point when thinking about the management of low testosterone, low sex drive, and androgen-related conditions like acne and hair loss due to elevated DHT.

SHBG increases when inflammation is present. It seems to be a way of protecting us as if the body is saying “let’s not prioritize reproduction right now.” Inflammation is measured by the lab test hs-CRP, although not always linked.

Test results may vary depending on your age, gender, health history, weight, the health of your liver, if you have hyperthyroidism (Graves’ Disease), and/or if you’re on hormone replacement therapy.

### Prolactin

| Reference range  |
| ---------------- |
| 2.0 - 18.0 ng/mL |

Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland—a small gland located underneath the brain. This test helps detect issues with the pituitary gland, which may include a tumor. A malfunctioning pituitary gland could be the cause of decreased libido and/or erectile dysfunction; so, if you’re experiencing either of those, this might help point to the cause.

### Free Testosterone

| Optimal range | Reference range |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| > 20 pg/mL    | 35 - 155 pg/mL  |

Testosterone is produced in the testicles (with small amounts from the adrenal glands). In the brain, the hypothalamus and pituitary glands control how much testosterone is actually made. Testosterone is an extraordinary hormone with a hefty duty list. In all adults, healthy levels of testosterone are important for general health, body composition, sexual function, and the reduction of disease risk. It aids in:

- Development of the penis and testes
- Deepening of the voice during puberty
- Regulating fat distribution, and bone and muscle mass/growth
- Sex drive (libido)
- Production of red blood cells and sperm
- Signaling the secretion of LH and FSH
- Enhancing mood and motivation
- Helping to build lean tissue

Free testosterone is testosterone not bound to proteins (like SHBG), meaning it is freely flowing through the bloodstream before taking on a task in a target cell. This test measures the amount of “free” testosterone hormones available to be used.

Interesting side note: cholesterol is one of testosterone’s (and estrogen’s) building blocks, so healthy cholesterol directly impacts healthy testosterone.

### Total Testosterone

| Optimal range | Reference range  |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| > 500 ng/dL   | 250 - 1100 ng/dL |

Testosterone is produced in the testicles (with small amounts from the adrenal glands). In the brain, the hypothalamus and pituitary glands control how much testosterone is actually made. Interesting side note: cholesterol is one of testosterone’s (and estrogen’s) building blocks, so healthy cholesterol directly impacts healthy testosterone.

Testosterone is an extraordinary hormone with a pretty important duty list. In all adults, healthy levels of testosterone are important for general health, body composition, sexual function, and the reduction of disease risk. It aids in:

- Development of the penis and testes
- Deepening of the voice during puberty
- Regulating fat distribution, and bone and muscle mass/growth
- Sex drive (libido)
- Production of red blood cells and sperm
- Signaling the secretion of LH and FSH
- Enhancing mood and motivation
- Helping to build lean tissue

Free testosterone is testosterone not bound to proteins (like SHBG), meaning it is freely flowing through the bloodstream before taking on a task in a target cell. Total testosterone counts the testosterone that is free and the testosterone that is bound to proteins (like SHBG).

You will naturally have a higher level of “total” than “free.” But, if your total is normal and you’re experiencing symptoms like low libido, fatigue, and reduced sex drive, it may suggest that there aren’t enough free hormones available for use. This can signal issues with your SHBG production or hypothalamus or pituitary gland. It may also suggest hypogonadism, a condition where your gonads aren’t producing hormones properly.

## Stress Hormone

### Cortisol

| Reference range 8-10 AM | Reference range 4-6 PM |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 4.6-20.6 mcg/dL         | 1.8-13.6 mcg/dL        |

Cortisol is made in the adrenal glands and released when the pituitary gland detects stress. With healthy adrenal glands you will receive a healthy dose of cortisol and DHEA-S to control your body’s stress response. Cortisol, for one, is often referred to as “the stress hormone.”

It is regulated by the autonomic part of your nervous system, which has two parts: sympathetic and parasympathetic. Both are essential for human survival, however, they must be in balance for optimal health. When the “go go go” sympathetic system is high and the parasympathetic low, it may lead to stress, anxiety, nervousness, insomnia, and ultimately fatigue and collapse if left untreated.  The parasympathetic is important for your "rest and digest" systems and can impact your digestion, mood, and sleep rhythms. If cortisol is HIGH, it can inhibit your parasympathetic nervous system.

Most cells in the body have cortisol receptors on them that transport information, so the impact of this biomarker is wide-reaching from the head, shoulders, knees, toes, and a lot of things in between. As a stress hormone, cortisol helps you evaluate a threat, which then triggers your fight or flight response. When a threat is detected, adrenaline (also known as epinephrine or norepinephrine) is released and this leads to increased heart rate, tightness of the chest, pupil dilation, and blood glucose release. It also shuts down the digestive system and puts you on high alert, which can affect sleep.

Once the immediate threat is resolved, cortisol comes in to sustain the body for ongoing vigilance but does not have the same immediacy that adrenaline hormones provide. Over time, cortisol can become exhausted and may lead to secondary adrenal insufficiency, causing severe fatigue and depletion if these threats are frequent.

When the stress trigger goes away, the cortisol cools off a bit. However, if you’re constantly stressed, cortisol will remain elevated and distract it from doing its other jobs, such as:

- Aiding in stress response
- Controlling blood sugar and blood pressure
- Mitigating inflammatory mediators
- Regulating metabolism, glucose, and insulin release
- Countering allergies
- Converting proteins into energy by increasing amino acids in the bloodstream
- Supporting developing fetus during pregnancy

If your cortisol levels are always high, leading to a continuously elevated stress response, it can cause adverse reactions throughout your entire body. Look again at the above duties of cortisol, and see how unhealthy levels can impact you:

- Increased inflammation and weakened immune function
- Depletion of cortisol and lower blood sugar
- Weakened metabolism that could lead to increased lipid levels of blood fats and malabsorption of minerals like potassium
- Decreased insulin sensitivity and increased risk of diabetes, and thus insulin resistance
- Abnormal weight gain
- Loss of the capacity to produce sufficient DHEA

For women with irregular periods and increased facial hair, cortisol levels could help understand the cause.

## Autoimmunity

### Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA)

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| >25 %           |

Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are a type of antibody created by the immune system. In a healthy immune system, antibodies are intended to attack and destroy unfriendly microbes and toxins that enter the body. However, ANA (often referred to as autoantibodies) mistakenly target friendly tissues and organs that are essential to your body’s healthy functioning. They attack the nucleus of the cell, hence the technical name. When the immune system goes after self tissue, it is known as autoimmunity.

As an example, we’ll look at a common autoimmune disorder, Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (relevant biomarkers here are Thyroid Peroxidase and Thyroglobulin) where antibodies form in the tissue of the thyroid, leading to destruction and reduced function of the thyroid to produce its main product: the thyroid hormone. A far less common, but potentially more destructive autoimmune condition is lupus, which can attack multiple tissue types including the skin, kidneys, liver, and lungs to name a few.

The cause of autoimmunity is multi-factorial. One potential hypothesis of the immune system attacking “the self” is a leaky gut. This is when the digestive symptom repeatedly encounters a pro-inflammatory stimulus (like a non-beneficial microbe, food particle, or environmental toxins), leading to the formation of gaps along the lining of the digestive tract. Underlying that lining is robust immune tissue called GALT (gut-associated lymphoid tissue). This creates an opportunity for our immune system to be more and more reactive if the inflammatory stimulus is not removed.

ANA levels reveal the susceptibility to an autoimmune disease. However, this test won’t diagnose specific autoimmune disorders. There are specific panels of antibodies your doctor may order as a follow-up if this test is positive. If your ANA is elevated and you are healthy, it may be a sign that you have pre-autoimmune disease, meaning you’re vulnerable to developing a condition.

But, a positive result won’t necessarily mean you have a disease. Many healthy people have antinuclear antibodies in their blood. In addition, certain medicines can affect your results.

The good news is a lot of autoimmune diseases can be diverted or healed by taking steps that reduce inflammation and circumvent an autoimmune flare-up. This can be done by avoiding inflammatory foods, environmental or household toxins, and reducing unnecessary stress.

### Rheumatoid Factor

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| <14 IU/mL       |

Rheumatoid factors are antibodies produced by your immune system. Normally, the immune system produces antibodies that attack disease-causing invaders, but rheumatoid factors attack healthy joints, glands, or other normal cells by mistake, leading to autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid vasculitis, or Sjögren’s syndrome.

While a high concentration of rheumatoid factor may be associated with a number of diseases, healthy individuals with no medical problems may also have higher concentrations of rheumatoid factor, indicating pre-autoimmunity.  As with most autoimmune diseases, RA is caused by inflammation, so self-care matters. Finding your particular triggers (dairy, gluten, corn, heavy metal toxicity, chronic stress, to name a few possibilities) can help alleviate symptoms and potentially eradicate the condition.

The "normal" range (or negative test result) for rheumatoid factor is less than 14 IU/ml. Any result with values 14 IU/ml or above is considered abnormally high, elevated, or positive.

## Immunity

### White Blood Cell Count

| Optimal range    | Reference range        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| 5-11 Thousand/uL | 3.8 - 10.8 Thousand/uL |

White blood cells (WBC) are one of four compounds of the blood, along with red blood cells, platelets, and plasma. WBCs are a core part of your immune system and only live two to three weeks. Because of this, your bone marrow is constantly making more.

There are five types—granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), monocytes, and lymphocytes (T cells and B cells). Think of WBCs as the army that fights infections and diseases, each with a specific job: from destroying foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses and creating antibodies to fight them off to sweeping out the waste left behind during infectious combat. WBCs even help fight malignant diseases, such as cancer. It’s important that the WBC army is in tip-top shape, so that when you encounter sickness or even something that triggers an allergy, your body is strong enough and well-equipped for battle.

The five types of WBC are:

- Neutrophils are the first responders.
- Basophils release histamine to mount an innate/non-specific immune response.
- Eosinophils fight bacteria and parasites but also provoke allergy symptoms.
- Lymphocytes are B and T cells that defend against very specific invaders.
- Monocytes clean up dead cells.

WBCs vary from day to day, throughout the day, and from person to person. A WBC count can be used to detect a disease or condition affecting white blood cells, but it cannot determine the underlying cause. If your white blood cells are high, it means your body is producing more in order to fight something off. If low, then something caused them to deplete. If your WBC count is abnormal, other tests can help diagnosis, such as:

- Blood smear review: looks at blood through a microscope to see the size, shape, and number of blood cells. This helps diagnose blood disorders.
- Bone marrow examination: checks on the health of your blood marrow and if it’s producing blood cells at a normal rate.
- WBC differential: indicates what type of WBC is low or high.

### Neutrophils (Absolute and %)

#### Absolute

| Optimal range        | Reference range    |
| -------------------- | ------------------ |
| 1400 - 7000 cells/uL | 1500-7800 cells/uL |

#### Percentage (%)

| Optimal range |
| ------------- |
| 50 - 70%      |

In the immune system army, neutrophils are the patrollers and first responders that move freely around your entire body and immediately attack all antigens in their path. When they suspect an invader (bacteria or virus) is threatening the immune system, they are usually the first cells to the scene. Then they release pro-inflammatory chemicals to call in other white blood cells to the scene as the backup and clean-up crew.

### Lymphocytes (Absolute and %)

#### Absolute

| Optimal range       | Reference range   |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| 700 - 3100 cells/uL | 850-3900 cells/uL |

#### Percentage (%)

| Optimal range |
| ------------- |
| 20 - 40%      |

Lymphocytes come in two major forms: B cells and T cells. Unlike other white blood cells that provide non-specific immunity (going to the sight of inflammation, injury, etc.), B and T cells have precise purposes (fighting off specific illnesses). Lymphocytes use past patterns, behaviors, and interactions with invaders to recognize specific foreign threats and attack them when they reappear. Take a look at the breakdown:

- B lymphocytes (B cells) are responsible for humoral immunity, which is the immune response that involves antibodies, the cells that target and attack foreign pathogens that enter the body. B cells produce the antibodies that "remember" an infection. If you get sick, the B cell army files the code of that infection and remembers it so if you are exposed to those same pathogens again, the B cells can swiftly eradicate it. It _recalls_ the pathogenic code! This is how a vaccine works!
- T lymphocytes (T cells) directly kill cells that have been penetrated by an infection. T cells also help to activate other immune cells, produce cytokines, and regulate the immune response.
- Honorable mention: “Natural Killer” cells. Need we say more? These cells will kill tumors without prior knowledge of their presence. They just go right ahead and start gnawing away at the threat. Naturally.

### Monocytes (Absolute and %)

#### Absolute

| Optimal range      | Reference range  |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| 100 - 900 cells/uL | 200-950 cells/uL |

#### Percentage (%)

| Optimal range |
| ------------- |
| 4 - 8%        |

Like other WBCs, monocytes help the immune system destroy invaders. But, they also facilitate healing and repair. So, they’re like the reserve forces of your body’s army being called to duty when needed. Monocytes are phagocytic cells, which means they break down infections by eating them. Imagine Pacman traveling through the body gobbling up viruses, debris, bacteria, and/or infected cells that are sick.

Here’s the process:

An area of infection or injury occurs. Neutrophils are the first responders on the scene and rush to neutralize the infection or prevent one from starting. In that process, they send out chemical signals that monocytes receive and use to slowly make their way into the tissue space. Once they are out of the blood, they become macrophages, which eat the mess the neutrophils have just created. It’s a beautiful system and works well most of the time. However, in cases like a “cytokine storm”—an exaggerated inflammatory response—the system becomes overwhelmed and too many pro-inflammatory chemicals and cells are recruited. This may sound familiar because cytokine storms occurred and caused complications in COVID-19.

When monocytes enter tissue space, they transform into either macrophages or dendritic cells:

- **Macrophage cells**: monocytes move through the bloodstream to organs (liver, spleens, lungs, and bone marrow) and attach themselves to tissues then transform into macrophage cells. Here, they remain on organs and tissues and can do some incredible things: remove dead tissue, kill cancer cells, and assist the body’s immunity in attacking foreign invaders.
- **Dendritic cells:** this form of cells collaborates with T-cells. Dendritic cells give the T-cells a briefing (in the form of leftover debris from the virus, bacteria, and other substances). The T-cells then use this information to formulate a fighting plan to eradicate what’s still harming the body.

### Eosinophils (Absolute and %)

#### Absolute

| Optimal range    | Reference range |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| 0 - 400 cells/uL | 15-500 cells/uL |

#### Percentage (%)

| Optimal range |
| ------------- |
| 0 - 6%        |

Eosinophils are called to inflamed areas to trap substances, kill cells, parasites, and bacteria, and help tame an allergic response. This WBC is best known for triggering allergy symptoms and often gets pretty enthusiastic about its job by mounting an immune response against something harmless. For example, eosinophils mistake pollen for a foreign invader, and people who react to pollen trigger an overactive eosinophil response.

Eosinophils account for no more than 5% of the white blood cells in your bloodstream. This WBC can sometimes exceed levels in various parts of the body, typically the digestive tract.

However, eosinophils’ main targets include the following, which often present themselves in the digestive tract. If high, it may be due to an infection somewhere in the digestive system (anywhere from the esophagus to the large intestine):

- Viruses
- Bacteria
- Fungi
- Intestinal worms (helminths) and other parasites: It is helpful to note if eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes are all elevated, the probability of a digestive parasite is high.

### Basophils (Absolute and %)

#### Absolute

| Optimal range    | Reference range  |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 0 - 200 cells/uL | 0 - 200 cells/uL |

#### Percentage (%)

| Optimal range |
| ------------- |
| 0 - 1%        |

Basophils account for only around 1% of white blood cells, but play a role in allergy defense and stimulating antibodies against pathogens and parasitic organisms (ticks and worms) that cause injury/infection. As a granulocyte (meaning they are made up of little granules), basophil cells open up and release histamine or heparin when inflammation occurs from foreign molecules, IgE antibodies, or another specific signal from cells. These granules then travel throughout the bloodstream to attack the source.

- **Histamines** open up blood vessels and increase blood flow. If something seems suspicious or is actively bothering you, basophil will step in and release histamine on it. But, histamine is the main cause of allergy symptoms. When overloaded, it can result in inflammation and inflammation of mucous membranes, including the airways.
- **Heparin** is a blood thinner and will prevent blood clots from forming at the site of injury or infection.

Together, these two create a clear pathway for other cells to quickly get to the site of infection/inflammation. Like, a presidential motorcade clearing traffic.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)

| Optimal range | Reference range |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| <0.7 mg/L     | <1 mg/L         |

High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is made in the liver and sent into your bloodstream in response to inflammation.

Inflammation is when your healing mechanisms rush to the scene to focus on the injury or place of illness. When your body is injured or has an infection, inflammation occurs to protect the tissues. When you have a fever, your body is “in flames” because it is working in overdrive to protect you from illness.

However…if your systems are constantly responding to bodily stress and thus in inflammation mode all the time, it can lead to chronic inflammation. In fact, prolonged inflammation is a hidden killer. The risk of chronic inflammation is a whisper in today’s health conversation when it should be a scream or even a protest! Chronic inflammation is linked to every major disease: heart disease, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, Alzheimer’s, depression, all autoimmune diseases, and severe allergic reactions, like asthma.  Also, hs-CRP increases risk of cholesterol particles (small ones particularly) getting into the vessel lining and contributing to plaque build-up.

The hs-CRP test detects inflammation in your body and can be used to determine risk for all inflammatory conditions, including heart disease and stroke, even before symptoms occur. Elevation of hs-CRP may also be associated with increased risk of autoimmune disease, type 2 diabetes, and other chronic conditions. However, this test does not diagnosis the cause of your inflammation, so if you find your levels are elevated, you’ll need to investigate your personal triggers and a plan to tame your inflammation.

## Heart

### Total Cholesterol

| Optimal range   | Reference range |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| 100 - 199 mg/dL | <200 mg/dL      |

Your total cholesterol test measures the sum of both HDL and LDL cholesterols. And while your total cholesterol _does_ matter, the quality of your cholesterol and the ratio of the other cholesterol tests are important for a more complete picture of your heart health. Total cholesterol isn’t a sole measure for diagnosing disease or risk, so keep that in mind when reviews your levels.

**Is cholesterol good or bad?**

Cholesterol is a good thing and is often misunderstood. It is a fatty substance produced by the liver that travels through your bloodstream to help perform thousands of bodily functions. Here are an important few:

- Cells: builds cell membranes, the covering of your nerve sheaths, and much of the brain.
- Hormones: promotes hormone production. Because of this, without cholesterol you would not be able to maintain adequate levels of testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, and cortisol.
- Brain function: the brain is the most cholesterol-rich organ in the body and hence, needs it to maintain its strength
- Vitamin D: Requires cholesterol to synthesize the vitamin when sun makes contact with the skin, which has great benefits to your immune system and mental health

This is all wonderful and harmonious until oxidative stress and free radicals swoop in to trigger inflammation. As you may guess, this is a result of several factors varying from person to person: genetics, age, tobacco, unhealthy foods, hydrogenated oils, and sugar, to name a few. When this occurs, it causes what Dr. Hyman calls “rancid fat.” So, think of something going rancid: a browning apple or molding bread. Now, think of that happening inside of your body. LDL turns rancid if it is oxidized. It goes from fluffy, productive cholesterol to small, dense balls that can easily enter the arteries and form plaque buildup or cholesterol deposits.

HDL, on the other hand, is the good cop. When balanced, it can normally grab your LDL and take it away from your arteries and back to your liver where it can be broken down and excreted from the body. However, if there is an unhealthy amount of LDL, it’s easier for it to accumulate. You want the ratio of HDL to LDL to be 1:1.

Cholesterol is problematic, according to Dr. Hyman, when it comes from processed sugars **_and unhealthy fat_**. Let’s take a look.

Sources of sugar and unhealthy fats

- Sugar and sweeteners: refined white sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, artificial sweeteners (aspartame, sucralose, saccharin acesulfame potassium), high-fructose corn syrup, agave, brown rice syrup, evaporated cane juice,
- Dairy: milk, yogurt, cream, butter, cheese, ice cream
- Fried: doughnuts, french fries, fried chicken
- Fast foods: most drive-thru foods
- Baked goods: pie crusts, biscuits, breakfast pastries, cookies
- Snacks: crackers, popcorn, potato chips
- Processed oils and spreads: soybean canola, corn, safflower, sunflower, palm, peanut, vegetable, vegetable shortening, margarine, and anything that says “hydrogenated”
- Boxed and frozen: pizza, lasagna, ravioli, mac and cheese, enchiladas
- Some non-dairy coffee creamers: if you notice hydrogenated oils on the label, which make the creamers smooth and thick, then put it back on the shelf

Healthy sources of cholesterol

- Meat: grass-fed, regeneratively raised bison, elk, venison, poultry in moderation
- Wild or sustainably-raised coldwater fish: salmon, herring, mackerel, small halibut, and sardines
- Oils: flaxseed, coconut, avocado, extra virgin olive oil, ghee (clarified butter), walnut oil, macadamia nut oil
- Nuts and seeds: almonds, cashews, pecans, walnuts, macadamia, hazelnuts, brazil nuts, pistachios, chia, hemp, flax, pumpkin, sesame
- Pasture-raised eggs
- Avocado

**What else impacts cholesterol?**

Normal levels of cholesterol vary by age and gender. You can have a positive impact on your cholesterol by controlling negative emotions or stress, and maintaining healthy blood sugar and blood pressure. Genetics can be involved with high cholesterol and some people are highly sensitive to fluctuating ranges because of this. If you are genetically predisposed to low or high cholesterol, it’s important to see a specialist or cardiologist who can best direct you on how to maintain a healthy balance.

Your total cholesterol should be under 180, with a breakdown like this:

- Total cholesterol < 180 mg/dl
- LDL cholesterol < 70 mg/dl
- HDL cholesterol > 60 mg/dl
- Triglycerides < 100 mg/dl
- Total cholesterol/HDL ratio < 3.0
- Triglyceride to HDL ratio < 4

### Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) Cholesterol

| Optimal range  | Reference range |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| 50 - 100 mg/dL | <100 mg/dL      |

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is responsible for carrying cholesterol to cells. But, despite its good intentions, LDL is known as the “bad” cholesterol because when particle levels are too high and also small in size, they can more easily enter your arteries and cause the formation of plaque.

Think of it this way, the LDL particle isn’t the problem by itself, it is when it gets into the lining of the blood vessel and starts to expand into what’s known as a foam cell. Foam cells are big fluffy expansive cells that contribute to plaque build-up that can narrow the arteries or arterioles (smaller arteries) and increase the risk of heart attack or stroke. So this begs the question, how do we keep LDL out of the vessel lining? By reducing inflammation (hs-CRP) and insulin resistance (insulin, Hba1c, glucose). Both can lead to dysfunction of the cells that line the vasculature and eradicate unneeded cholesterol from our digestive tract through bile salts binding to fiber.

When you’re out of optimal range, it means you have too much LDL cholesterol in your blood, and you’re at increased risk for cardiovascular diseases. According to Dr. Hyman, conventional treatment for cholesterol focuses only on lowering LDL with a medication called statins (most commonly, however, there are others). LDL is measured and treated because it’s what healthcare has the best drugs for, not because it is the most important marker of your risk of heart disease. In fact, your LDL alone isn’t an accurate predictor of your risk of heart disease. Rather, your total heart health profile gives the complete picture.

### High-density lipoprotein (HDL) Cholesterol

| Optimal range   | Reference range |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Male: >50 mg/dL | Male: >39 mg/dL |

When remembering the difference between HDL and LDL, think of the H as healthy, helpful, heart-supporting cholesterol. HDLs help keep LDLs in check by transporting them and other excess or unused cholesterol from the body’s tissues back to the liver where it is broken down and disposed of.

HDL reduces buildup. So, if there aren’t enough of them to control LDL, then LDL can start accumulating in the arteries and form plaque. Your HDL levels are one component in determining your risk for heart disease. A high HDL to LDL ratio is good, as it helps keep arteries open and your blood flowing more freely. While there is no data that demonstrates elevated HDL levels to be harmful, there is no evidence that raising HDL above 60 reduces cardiac event outcomes like a heart attack or stroke.

### Apolipoprotein B (apoB)

| Optimal range      | Reference range |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| 0.00 - 90.00 mg/dL | <90 mg/dL       |

The number of Apolipoprotein B (apoB) particles in your plasma is one of the most telling metrics in understanding your risk of heart disease and atherosclerosis. This test is especially important if you have a family or personal history of cardiovascular disease. If this number is high, your risk is high.

ApoB is produced in the small intestine and liver, and it transports fat molecules (such as cholesterol) to all the body's cells and tissues. High levels of apoB, especially when LDL particle concentrations are also high, are the primary driver of the formation of plaques that cause vascular disease.

**How does ApoB work?**

First, apolipoproteins bind various lipids to form lipoproteins. There are a few types of apolipoproteins, but the one of concern is apoB, which is primarily attached to LDL particles. Because of this, there is a strong relationship between those two biomarkers.

ApoB is made in the liver and intestines. From there, it can attach itself to the LDL particle, making it more problematic and high risk. In a very brief summary of a complicated mechanism, apoB has a folded structure (or “kringled”) that allows it to be loaded with lipid molecules (triglycerides and cholesterol), which don’t dissolve in water (like a glass of oil and water; they just don’t mix). Combining water-soluble proteins with these lipids allows the apoB to carry them throughout the body for various needs: hormone development, adrenal metabolites, cell membranes, vitamin D synthesis. Dr. Tsimikas has done incredible work associated with cardiovascular risk. He describes apoB as pack mules that can load and offload the cargo it’s carrying on its kringles: VLDL, IDL, various sizes of LDL, OxLDL, and OxPL.

Since apoB is mostly made of LDL, we’ll concentrate on that for now. LDLs are the primary carriers of cholesterol in the blood, and apoB helps them attach to receptors on the surface of cells, mostly in the liver. Once attached, the receptors transport LDLs into the cell where they are broken down so that cholesterol can be released. The cholesterol is then used by the cell, stored, or removed from the body. This is a good thing!

However, Dr. Krauss, who also studies this mechanism, has shown this becomes a problem when the LDL burden is too much for the cells to take the cholesterol out of the blood quickly through the liver. When this occurs, LDL builds up in the blood and gets into the arteries where it becomes pathologic. So it's this inefficient removal of LDL that potentially accumulates in the blood and ultimately in the arteries. “This is the fundamental reason that we, as a species, are so susceptible to heart disease risk,” Dr. Krauss has said.

**What is this measuring?**

Biologically, apoB stays in the blood longer. And because apoB-containing particles are 90-95% LDLs, apoB measurement represents LDL particle concentration.

### Lipoprotein (a) or Lp(a)

| Optimal range | Reference range |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| <50 nmol/L    | <75 nmol/L      |

The goal of a Lipoprotein (a) test is early detection of cardiovascular problems. Statistics show that 50% of the people who suffer from heart attacks have normal cholesterol levels. Alternatively, it is well established that Lp(a) is a risk factor that influences cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis.

Every Lp(a) particle is attached to an LDL particle BUT not every LDL particle has an Lp(a). If it does, however, it becomes more dangerous and atherogenic, thus increasing cardiovascular risk.  This means that if Lp(a) is elevated, so is your risk of a cardiac event. According to Dr. Tsimikas, unlike unhealthy cholesterol levels, which are frequently linked to diet and other lifestyle choices, a person’s Lp(a) levels are mostly determined by genes that can be passed down through families.

With that said, if your results reveal elevated Lp(a), consult with a cardiologist or lipidologist who can guide your prevention path tailored to your personal history and lifestyle.

Lp(a), in particular, is a type of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). According to Dr. Tsimikas, Lp(a) particles can transport cholesterol, but they can also contribute to the buildup of plaque in the arteries, heightening the risk of heart attacks and stroke.

**Why density matters**

Remember, lipoproteins are made up of protein, cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipid molecules. As lipoproteins circulate through the blood, those molecules evolve. Some are removed and some are added. As this process occurs, low-density ones (LDL) and high-density ones (HDL) change in size: from large and fluffy (those with a high proportion of triglycerides) to small and dense (those with a high proportion of cholesterol). If LDLs are small and dense, they can more easily enter arteries and lead to plaque buildup.

Dr. Krauss says small particles become dangerous because they tend to circulate in the blood longer and are not cleared out by the liver. This is because their structure does not bind well to the receptors in the liver that are responsible for disposing them from the blood. Smaller particles that are not taken out effectively tend to circulate longer. That increased residence time means they float around the blood longer, enter the arteries, and tend to stick to the artery wall.

A few things can impact your Lp(a) levels:

- Family history of high cholesterol: there are people that are genetically wired to make too many of these small particles
- Low testosterone or estrogen
- Pregnancy
- Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)
- Chronic inflammation and/or autoimmune diseases
- Hypothyroidism
- Diabetes
- Unhealthy diet and obesity
- Alcohol and smoking

### Lipoprotein Fractionation (6)

#### LDL Particle Number

| Optimal range   | Reference range |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| 0 - 1000 nmol/L | <1138 nmol/L    |

#### LDL Small

| Optimal range  | Reference range |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| 0 - 100 nmol/L | <142 nmol/L     |

#### LDL Medium

| Optimal range  | Reference range |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| 0 - 200 nmol/L | <215 nmol/L     |

#### HDL Large

| Optimal range | Reference range |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 6729 nmol/L   | >6729 nmol/L    |

#### LDL pattern

| Optimal range | Reference range |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| A             | A               |

#### LDL Peak Size

| Optimal range | Reference range |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 223 Angstrom  | >222.9 Angstrom |

Fractionation measures the size and number of your LDL particles in circulation, which can be summarized by two major forms: smaller and denser versus larger and more buoyant. Particle size and number are the primary drivers of atherosclerosis. And abnormalities are typically caused by insulin resistance.

This test further examines personal risk for coronary artery disease, when compared to others in your lipid panel. This test is a helpful risk marker for those with a family history of heart attack or stroke, those taking cholesterol medication, or if someone has had a cardiac event with normal cholesterol levels.

Dr. Krauss has led the research in the development of the lipoprotein fractionation biomarker. His studies show that size and density capture important features of risk assessment because people with a higher risk of heart disease and people who have evidence of heart disease tend to have a lot of the smaller and denser LDL particles. People who are generally healthy tended to have more of the larger and buoyant LDL.

### **Tests included**

Below are what this test measures, and what each particle type means. It’s a bit of a numbers game trying to understand the scope of your results and a lot of factors go into a diagnosis or risk assessment. Because of this, it is best to discuss your levels with a doctor if they are out of range:

1. **LDL particle number** (should be less than 1000): the number of LDL particles circulating in the blood at a given time.
2. **LDL small** (should be less than 100): the smaller the particles, the more apt they are to enter the arteries. When there are a large number of small LDL particles, it may be a signal of increased risk or insulin resistance.
3. **LDL medium** (should be less than 200): as the size of the LDL particles get bigger, they are less apt to enter the arteries.
4. **HDL large** (should be greater than 6729): large HDL particles help remove excess particles of unhealthy cholesterol.
5. **LDL pattern** (A is optimal, B is risk marker): Pattern A are bigger, more buoyant particles, which are usually not associated with heart disease. Pattern B particles are smaller and denser. These types of particles are typically a risk marker.
6. **LDL peak size** (should be greater than 223 angstroms): a larger LDL particle is less likely to get into the vessel lining.

Dr. Krauss and his colleagues found that within these profiles, the highest risk was related to particles that actually have less cholesterol in them. This led them to rethink the role of cholesterol: yes, cholesterol goes up in the arteries but how does the cholesterol get there in the first place?

They found that smaller particles carry less cholesterol, which may seem less harmful. However, they have a greater tendency to enter the artery wall and bind tightly to artery tissue. So, once they are in arteries, they stick and oxidize more rapidly. While smaller and more dense particles bring cholesterol into the arteries, the sticky oxidative properties make them more damaging than the larger LDL carrying more cholesterol.

Fractionation gives a clearer picture of your cardiac risk because even if your total cholesterol, LDL, or HDL levels are in a “healthy” range, the size of those particles illuminates the threat of cholesterol entering the arteries and sticking. Of course, this all varies depending on genetics, gender, weight, lifestyle, and age. Certain diseases and conditions, such as diabetes and excess body weight, especially around the middle, are associated with increased levels of small dense LDL.

### Triglycerides

| Optimal range | Reference range |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 0 - 149 mg/dL | <150 mg/dL      |

Triglycerides are the most common type of fat in the body that stores excess energy from your diet. While and after you eat, your body takes calories and converts what it doesn’t use into triglycerides. The triglycerides go into fat cells until hormones release them for energy between meals. If you’re eating more calories than you burn, then triglyceride levels will be higher and won’t be put to good use. Usually, high triglyceride levels are associated with being overweight, alcohol abuse, smoking, a sedentary lifestyle, or having diabetes with elevated blood sugar levels.

Triglycerides are also seen as a marker of carbohydrate metabolism. When eating starch or sugar, the body attempts to store the extra we don’t need as glycogen. However, there is a limited amount of glycogen storage available in humans. The remainder begins to store as triglycerides.

So, insulin resistance and triglyceride storage are related because the insulin hormone is the signal that tells the body to store more triglycerides. Yes, store more fat.

The triglyceride storage can be added not only to peripheral tissue (where we notice it the most) but also to organs, such as the liver. The more triglyceride is stored in the liver, the higher the risk of fatty liver disease. This can be demonstrated with evidence by seeing mildly elevated levels of AST and ALT, and decreased levels of adiponectin.

## Thyroid

### Thyroglobulin Antibody (TgAb)

| Optimal range | Reference range |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 0-1 IU/mL     | < or = 1 IU/mL  |

Thyroglobulin is a protein in the thyroid needed to make Triiodothyronine (T3) and Thyroxine (T4) hormones. Both of these hormones control your metabolism and tissue/cell growth. The Thyroglobulin Antibodies (TgAb) test is used to check the amount of antibodies your body has made against your thyroglobulin. If there is a presence of TgAb, it is a sign of autoimmune thyroiditis.

Why is this important? You may recall that antibodies help fight off bacteria, viruses, and toxins. Normally, your immune system doesn't make significant levels of antibodies against your thyroglobulin because it's not "foreign" to your body. In people with a thyroid-related autoimmune condition, however, the blood level of TgAb is elevated. This means something is causing antibodies to attack the thyroid.

Autoimmune attacks against the thyroid may be related to environmental or food triggers. An example of this is the protein gliadin, part of the gluten molecule, found in wheat products. Interestingly, gluten has a chemical structure similar to the proteins in the thyroid gland. This is called molecular mimicry. Therefore, when someone has gluten sensitivity, the immune system is not only producing antibodies against gluten, but it might also be producing them against the thyroid.

### Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO)

| Optimal range      | Reference range |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| 0.00 - 34.00 IU/mL | <9 IU/mL        |

The thyroid peroxidase is an enzyme that uses iodine to help produce the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). Both of these hormones control your metabolism and tissue and cell growth.

This is an antibody test, like the TgAb test, that checks if there are elevated antibodies that might be attacking your TPO. If there are, this is a sign of autoimmune thyroiditis. Ordinarily, your immune system doesn't make significant levels of antibodies against TPO because it's not "foreign" to your body. In people with a thyroid-related autoimmune condition, however, the blood level of TPO antibodies may rise.

When an antibody is made against thyroglobulin, it reduces the amount of storage and may lead to clinical hypothyroidism, which decreases the amount of thyroid hormones produced. Autoimmune attacks against the thyroid may be related to environmental triggers, inflammation, chronic stress, and more.

Therefore, this test helps diagnose autoimmune disorders that impact the thyroid, such as Hashimoto’s or hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) or Graves’ disease or hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid).

If other thyroid tests (T3, T4, and TSH) show that your thyroid hormone levels are too low or too high, TPO can help guide you and your doctor into understanding the root cause.

### Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)

| Optimal range     | Reference range   |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| 0.45 - 4.50 mIU/L | 0.40 - 4.50 mIU/L |

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is made in the pituitary gland (in the brain) and communicates with the thyroid to “make more thyroid hormones”: triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). When thyroid levels are low, the pituitary gland makes more TSH. When thyroid levels are high, the pituitary gland makes less TSH. Knowing whether your TSH levels are too high or too low can tell you if your thyroid is overactive (hyperthyroidism or Grave’s disease) or underactive (hypothyroidism or Hashimoto’s). The test can also detect a thyroid disorder before you have any symptoms.

### Thyroxine (T4) Free

| Optimal range     | Reference range |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| 0.60 - 1.20 ng/dL | 0.8 - 1.8 ng/dL |

Thyroxine, commonly referred to as T4, is produced in the thyroid then released into the bloodstream where it travels to various organs, like the liver and kidneys. At a certain point, it is converted to another form of a hormone called triiodothyronine (T3). The synergy of T4 and T3 is important for your heart and digestive function, metabolism, brain development, bone health, and muscle control. Both impact almost your entire body, which means proper T4 levels are vital for health. Abnormal T4 levels alone do not typically lead to symptoms but inadequate conversion to T3 or too much production of T3 can lead to feeling imbalanced. However, since T4 is free and not bound—meaning it can freely travel without being bound to another molecule—it can also exert its own influence for better or for worse.

T4 alongside T3 and TSH are all intertwined. Here’s how it works: the thyroid gland produces a large amount of T4. The rate and number of T4 are determined by TSH, which signals to the thyroid when and how much T4 to make. Then, an enzyme called _5' deiodinase_ converts the T4 to T3, mostly in the liver. In order to make this conversion, _5' deiodinase_ needs selenium. As with many things in your body, outside factors—stress, heavy metals, environmental toxins (pesticides, pollution, microplastics, chemicals), infections, and yeast—may disrupt this enzyme’s ability to work properly and hence make adequate amounts of T3.  Once the conversion is made, T3 is able to carry out its many jobs. So many jobs, in fact, that T3 is one of the most powerful hormones in the entire body.

This test is typically cross-referenced with TSH and free T3 levels. Sometimes T4 and TSH may appear normal while the free T3 is abnormal. Testing these in tandem can give great insight into your overall thyroid function.

### Triiodothyronine (T3) Free

| Optimal range   | Reference range |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| 3.0 - 4.4 pg/mL | 2.3 - 4.2 pg/mL |

T3 is the most powerful thyroid hormone in your body. It is incredibly important because it helps cells send messages to your DNA that increase metabolism and fat-burning in your mitochondria, and ensure the systems in your body are working at the right speed. When T3 is abnormal, you’ll feel it. Too high? You may live a hyperactive, anxious, overheated life. Too low? Sluggish and cold with a neverending feeling of brain fog.

When all T3 systems are a go, it helps:

- Regulate body temperature
- Control heart rate
- Lower your cholesterol
- Improve your memory
- Promote regrowth after hair loss
- Soothe muscle aches
- Regulate bowel movements
- Fertility

Most T3 in the blood is produced throughout the body when T4 is chemically converted to T3 by the _5' deiodinase_ enzyme. T3 typically binds to protein, so your total T3 depends on your protein levels and protein binding ability. However, your free T3 levels can indicate if there is an overabundance of the hormone due to an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism). If low, it can be because of an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism or Hashimoto’s).

## Blood

### ABO Group and Rh Type (Blood Type) (2)

This test, also known as blood typing, measures both the group (ABO) and positive/negative (Rh factor) of your blood. According to the American Red Cross, blood type is classified by the absence or presence of A or B antigens and Rh factor (an inherited protein) on the surface of blood cells. Positive blood types have Rh protein on blood cells, whereas negative blood types do not.

Blood is grouped into four major blood types:

- Type A
- Type B
- Type AB
- Type O

The most common blood types are A+, A-, B+, B-, O+, O-, AB+, AB-.

Knowing your blood type is incredibly valuable, especially in case of an emergency where a blood transfusion is needed. Compatible blood can save your life, whereas incompatible blood may cause blood cells to clump, which can be fatal.

It’s also important in case you want to donate blood. Oftentimes, there may be a shortage of a rare blood type, and if you have that blood type, you will know whether or not your help is needed.

### Red Blood Cell

| Optimal range          | Reference range        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 3.77 - 5.28 Million/uL | 4.20 - 5.80 Million/uL |

Red blood cells (RBCs) are made in the bone marrow. They contain a protein called hemoglobin, which carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. RBCs also carry carbon dioxide—a waste product of metabolism—to the lungs, where it is exchanged with oxygen and then exhaled. The lifespan of an RBC is 120 days, so your bone marrow always needs to make more to replace those that age or are lost through bleeding.

Everybody’s red cells and hemoglobin vary. For instance, high altitude increases RBC number and the risk of conditions like anemia, dehydration, bleeding, or other blood disorders that cause them to decrease.

### Hemoglobin

| Optimal range      | Reference range  |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| 11.10 - 15.90 g/dL | 13.2 - 17.1 g/dL |

Hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in the blood, generally reflects the number of red blood cells active in your blood. Sometimes this test will solve the mystery behind fatigue, shortness of breath, or dizziness. Abnormal hemoglobin levels may be a sign of anemia, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, or other blood disorders.

Hemoglobin levels are often used as a baseline to monitor and guide treatment for those with anemia or polycythemia vera, a rare blood disease in which the body produces too many red blood cells.

### Hematocrit

| Optimal range | Reference range |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 34% - 46.6%   | 38.5 - 50.0 %   |

The hematocrit test measures the number of red blood cells in the blood, including your blood’s thickness. This is important because if your total red blood cells are significantly above or below optimal, then there is something impacting the processes that make or release RBCs. Here’s a breakdown of blood in the body:

- 45% red blood cells
- less than 1% white blood cells and platelets
- 55% plasma

If your hematocrit is only just slightly above or below optimal levels, there isn’t cause for medication or treatment.

### Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)

| Optimal range | Reference range |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 85 - 90 fL    | 80.0 - 100.0 fL |

Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) measures the average size of the red blood cells in a blood sample: whether they are too big, too small, or just right. This test isn’t used as a sole diagnostic tool. Rather, it is compared to other blood and vitamin levels to diagnose, treat, and monitor many medical conditions. However, there are times that a doctor will want to look specifically at the MCV when evaluating symptoms or issues. Some of these include:

- Diagnosing different types of anemia and other health conditions.
- Evaluating other blood abnormalities, such as an abnormal white blood cell or platelet count

Your body will let you know if your blood levels are abnormal. Usually, these signals include paleness, fatigue, or cold hands and feet. Sometimes you might even bruise and bleed easier than normal. Listen to those signals. Oftentimes you’ll feel better with foods rich in iron or vitamin B.

### Red Corpuscular Distribution Width (RDW)

| Optimal range | Reference range |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 11.7% - 15.4% | 11.0 - 15.0 %   |

Red Corpuscular Distribution Width (RDW) is the size and volume of your red blood cells. Combined with your MCV results, an RDW measurement can detect the various types of anemia, especially if there is more than one type present at the same time. For example, if you are deficient in B12, folate, and iron you could have macrocytic anemia and microcytic anemia concurrently. Meaning your blood has a mixture of micro (small) and macro (big) red blood cells.

Overall, this test can assess your general well-being, whether or not you’re at risk for heart disease or cancer, and if a pregnant woman might become iron deficient (even before the deficiency occurs).

### Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH)

| Optimal range | Reference range |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 26.60 - 33 pg | 27.0 - 33.0 pg  |

Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) refers to the average amount of hemoglobin in your red blood cells. This test is usually done as part of your complete blood count to look at the overall health of your red blood cells.

You may notice your MCH and MCV levels are about the same. The difference is that your MCH levels provide important information on hyper-, hypo-, or normal anemia.

### Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC)

| Optimal range      | Reference range  |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| 31.50 - 35.70 g/dL | 32.0 - 36.0 g/dL |

In your MCHC biomarker, you’ll see the amount of hemoglobin per red blood cell. In contrast, MCHC is the amount of hemoglobin per unit volume. So, this test assesses the hemoglobin content with the volume of the cell. Very low MCHC values are typical of iron deficiency anemia, and very high MCHC values typically reflect spherocytosis or RBC agglutination.

### Platelet Count

| Optimal range         | Reference range       |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| 150 - 450 Thousand/uL | 140 - 400 Thousand/uL |

Platelets, which are made in the bone marrow, are small, colorless blood cells that form clots with the goal to stop or prevent bleeding. Here’s how it works: let’s say you nick yourself while chopping veggies. When bleeding begins, platelets adhere to the site of injury and clump together to form a “plug.” While they’re doing this, they release signals that attract and promote more platelets to join in and create a stable blood clot. This will remain in place until the injury heals.

Considering platelets' role in healing, it’s important to have a consistent and healthy flow of them. Too many can lead to them sticking together and causing blood clots, heart attack, or stroke. Too little may cause excessive bleeding if you have an injury.

Many medications can decrease platelet production, including:

- Aspirin
- Heparin
- Sulfa drugs (when taken in excess overtime)
- Quinidine
- Digoxin

### Mean Platelet Volume

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| 7.5 - 12.5 fL   |

MPV measures the mass of platelets. So, why does this matter? When platelets are healthy, there is a dynamic relationship between their size and count. Let’s say they are not healthy. When the platelet count is lower, the bone marrow megakaryocytes (which are responsible for making platelets) are stimulated by thrombopoietin (a protein) to make bigger platelets. When platelets have a higher volume, that protein might be working insufficiently and creating too many megakaryocytes.

MPV is particularly important in determining the cause of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count) or thrombocytosis (a high platelet count), and it can be useful to know even if your platelet count is normal.

## Liver Enzymes

### Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)

| Optimal range | Reference range |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 39 - 117 U/L  | 36 - 130 U/L    |

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme that breaks down proteins. It is found in tissue throughout the entire body but is most prevalent in the liver, bones, intestines, and kidneys. Often, abnormal levels can reflect tissue damage or issues with the organs and glands it serves.

When ALP is tested, it is most often part of a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) that includes other liver and kidney biomarkers. It may also help monitor your response to treatment for liver or bone diseases.

### Alanine Transaminase (ALT)

| Optimal range | Reference range |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 0 - 32 U/L    | 9 - 46 U/L      |

Your alanine transaminase (ALT) enzyme is mostly found in the liver, but also in skeletal muscle, kidney, and heart cells. Its main job in the liver is to help convert proteins into energy. If liver cells are damaged from excess alcohol, drugs, disease, or injury, ALT is released into the bloodstream. Checking on ALT in the blood guides you into understanding the health of your liver. Seeing high ALT levels from this test can help diagnose liver diseases, such as fatty liver, liver injury, hepatitis, or cirrhosis in the early stages.

When liver cells are injured, it causes a spill of ALT into the blood, which shows in elevated blood results. This signals potential liver damage.

### Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)

| Optimal range | Reference range |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 0 - 40 U/L    | 10 - 40 U/L     |

Your aspartate aminotransferase (AST) enzyme is mostly found in the liver, but also skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, and lungs. Its job includes metabolism of amino acids. Even if levels are abnormal, it doesn’t automatically mean intervention is needed. However, if there has been injury to the liver it could mean that these enzymes are breaking out and entering the bloodstream, which is why high levels could indicate a problem.

### Total Bilirubin

| Optimal range     | Reference range |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| 0.00 - 1.20 mg/dL | 0.2 - 1.2 mg/dL |

The liver makes bile to help you digest food, and bile contains bilirubin. Most bilirubin comes from the body's normal process of breaking down old red blood cells. A healthy liver can normally get rid of bilirubin. Normal results can vary, but high bilirubin levels can suggest a blockage in the liver, gallbladder, or the biliary tree (liver, gallbladder, pancreas).

In tandem with other liver biomarkers, this can help determine the cause of jaundice and/or help diagnose conditions such as liver disease, hemolytic anemia, or blockage of the bile ducts.

### Albumin

| Optimal range | Reference range |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 4 - 5 g/dL    | 3.6 - 5.1 g/dL  |

Albumin is a protein made by your liver that helps fluid in the bloodstream stay in the bloodstream, rather than leaking into other tissues. It also allows hormones, vitamins, and enzymes hitch a ride and travel throughout the body to their final destinations. Because of how many things albumin transports, it contributes to the absorption process of vital minerals, nutrients, and cells that your body needs to function.

In conjunction with other tests in the liver panel, this helps gauge the health of your liver and any underlying conditions you may be experiencing. This test can also be used as part of a comprehensive metabolic panel that measures electrolytes, glucose, and proteins in your blood.

Albumin can be impacted by malnutrition, digestive issues, and oxidative stress in addition to liver pathology.

### Total Protein

| Optimal range    | Reference range |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| 6.00 - 8.50 g/dL | 6.1 - 8.1 g/dL  |

The human body is made up of thousands of proteins, all of which have various roles in making and maintaining every cell, including enzymes and hormones. Proteins also fuel those cells and your immune system so you have the energy you need to wake up, go to work, and have a productive life.

This total protein test is composed of two blood proteins: albumin and total globulin. What impacts these two proteins will impact the total protein level. These proteins are both made in the liver, hence this test is primarily used to assess liver health. However, inadequate protein intake through diet or poor digestive absorption can both be suggested through the results of this test.

Proteins are cyclical and are continually being repaired and replaced. This natural process is known as protein synthesis, which relies on a proper supply of amino acids. Many amino acids come from broken-down proteins, but since the body and its functions aren’t always perfect, it’s important to get enough protein to keep up with the demand for amino acids.

If the result of your total protein test is abnormal, you may need to cross-reference with your metabolic panel to determine which proteins are too high or too low. Knowing the specific reason for your deficiency or abundance can help diagnose a number of health conditions, including:

- Kidney disease
- Liver disease
- Malnutrition

## Kidney

### Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)

| Optimal range      | Reference range |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| 6.00 - 24.00 mg/dL | 7 - 25 mg/dL    |

Let’s take a look into your kidneys whose main job is filtering and then removing waste and extra fluid from your body. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is one of the waste products your kidneys flush out, so this test checks if there is a build-up of urea nitrogen waste in your blood. Urea is formed in the liver from protein breakdown and digestion. Excessive urea indicates an imbalance in the production or clearance of the by-product. Higher than normal BUN levels may be a sign that your kidneys aren't working efficiently to filter waste out of the blood. Urea can also be elevated due to gut microbial production of ammonia, which is converted into BUN by the liver.

Typically, this test is compared with creatinine to monitor your kidney’s ability to regulate waste. If you have kidney disease, waste material can build up in your blood and may lead to serious health problems, including high blood pressure, anemia, and heart disease. In absence of elevated creatinine, it suggests there may be excessive dietary protein intake, usually in the form of supplemental amino acids.

### Creatinine

| Optimal range     | Reference range   |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| 0.57 - 1.00 mg/dL | 0.60 - 1.35 mg/dL |

Creatinine (not to be confused with creatine supplement) is a chemical compound left over from everyday wear and tear of your muscles. It is normal for the body to produce creatinine, and levels depend on age, gender, muscle mass, and race.

When the kidneys are healthy, they filter creatinine out of the blood where it then leaves your body as a waste product in urine. Typically, this test is used if someone is experiencing symptoms from diabetes-induced kidney disease (tired, trouble sleeping, blood in urine, foamy urine, and more), high blood pressure, or other conditions that increase the risk of kidney disease.

Also, testing creatinine helps monitor for side effects of drugs that can cause kidney damage or altered kidney function. However, because creatinine levels vary from person to person, this test on its own is not used as a sole diagnostic tool. Rather, it’s a signal for further investigation. Compare this test with your blood urea nitrogen (BUN), which will give you a better scope of your kidney health.

### Sodium

| Optimal range          | Reference range  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| 134.00 - 144.00 mmol/L | 135 - 146 mmol/L |

Sodium is both an electrolyte and mineral that maintains a balance between water and electrolytes in your body. It’s like a conductor for your blood pressure, muscles, and nerves. When sodium levels are low (hyponatremia), those vital functions can’t stay on track or in rhythm; when high (hypernatremia), sodium tilts the electrolyte balance and can lead to serious problems involving those mechanisms.

Sodium levels are affected by the adrenal glands and kidneys, the primary regulators of this important electrolyte. When your body needs more sodium, your adrenal glands and kidneys have careful response systems to ensure the release of sodium into the blood. Thus low or high sodium is always a sign of something atypical.

Abnormal electrolyte levels may be a sign of dehydration, kidney disease, liver disease, heart failure, high blood pressure, or other disorders. But for most people, keeping sodium levels in check is not a problem. However, when something like diarrhea or profuse vomiting occurs, you may become dehydrated and lose electrolytes. In this case, it’s always important to restore yourself with more electrolytes.

In rare instances, individuals who suffer from fainting spells or kidney or hormone-related diseases, or those taking certain prescribed medications, need to be careful not to let their sodium intake drop below a certain level.

According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, cutting down on sodium intake may reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.

## Electrolytes

### Chloride

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| 98 - 110 mmol/L |

Chloride is a major electrolyte in your body, and you need it to stay healthy. Like its electrolyte brethren—sodium and potassium—chloride manufactures channels in cell membranes, which carry out different vital tasks, like helping:

- Cells take in and put out nutrients and water
- Muscles contract
- Digestion
- Oxygenation
- Nerves transport messages from the brain to the rest of the body
- Balance fluids and regulate blood pressure

Chloride is found naturally in foods and most often in table salt (aka sodium chloride). Abnormal electrolyte levels may be a sign of dehydration, kidney disease, liver disease, heart failure, high blood pressure, or other disorders. A chloride test is useful in diagnosing the underlying causes behind abnormal fluid levels or pH balances. Chloride is under the same control as sodium, thus when we see changes in sodium, it is expected to see the same in chloride.

### Potassium

| Reference range  |
| ---------------- |
| 3.5 - 5.3 mmol/L |

Like your other electrolytes, potassium is pretty important. In orchestra with sodium, it helps:

- Cells take in and put out nutrients and water
- Muscles contract
- Digestion
- Nerves transport messages from the brain to the body
- Balance fluids and regulate blood pressure

Abnormal electrolyte levels may be a sign of dehydration, kidney disease, liver disease, heart failure, high blood pressure, or other disorders. Potassium must stay balanced in your body when managing kidney disease. If your kidneys are not working well, potassium levels in your blood might get too high.

### Bicarbonate (Carbon Dioxide)

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| 20 - 32 mmol/L  |

Bicarbonate is an alkali of the electrolyte family. As an alkali, it plays a role in balancing the acid-base of your pH balance. pH levels measure the amount of acids and alkaline bases in your blood. Your body is built to maintain a healthy balance of acidity and alkalinity, and when either of those change, bicarbonate helps to rebalance them with some help from water, hydrogen, hemoglobin, phosphate, and carbon dioxide.

Here’s how it works: bicarbonate travels to your lungs through the bloodstream. When you exhale, bicarbonate leaves the body as carbon dioxide. Bicarbonate is also regulated by your kidneys. Both of these mechanisms help manage your body's overall pH balance.

If bicarbonate levels are too high or too low, it could mean your body is struggling to maintain its pH balance. This could be caused by an electrolyte imbalance or the inability to remove carbon dioxide from the body. Abnormal electrolyte levels may be a sign of dehydration, kidney disease, liver disease, heart failure, high blood pressure, or other disorders.

## Metabolic Health

### Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)

| Optimal range          | Reference range     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| 4 - 5.5 % of total Hgb | <5.7 % of total Hgb |

HbA1c is your estimated average glucose (sugar) levels found in your blood over a 75 to 90-day period. This measurement gauges inflammation in your body and helps diagnose and monitor treatment for prediabetes and diabetes. The American Diabetes Association dubs this test a “powerhouse” because of how revelatory it is for your health.

To look at the bigger picture of what HbA1c is testing, you’ll need to understand hemoglobin and A1c on their own:

- Hemoglobin: a protein found in red blood cells. It gives blood its red color, and its main duty is carrying oxygen throughout your body. When glucose builds up in your blood (high blood sugar/hyperglycemia), it binds to the hemoglobin in your red blood cells (RBCs).
- A1c: percentage of hemoglobin that is coated with glucose/sugar, otherwise known as “glycated hemoglobin.” In _Glucose Revolution,_ Inchauspé explains the Maillard reaction, a process in the body where things “brown” from the moment of birth; kind of like bread being toasted. Glycation is this process, and according to the science outlined in the book, “browning happens when a glucose molecule bumps into another type of molecule. That causes a reaction. The second molecule is then said to be glycated. When a molecule is glycated, it’s damaged.” The more glucose in the body, the more glycation occurs.

This test measures how many glucose molecules have been glycated within 75-90 days.

When blood sugar is chronically high, it accumulates in the red blood cell and tells a story about what has occurred over several months. It is important to note that HbA1c only rises after insulin resistance is typically already established. Diagnosis of prediabetes often follows after years of rising insulin. If you have diabetes, excess glucose in your blood can attach to hemoglobin and raise the level of HbA1c.

According to Inchauspé, a diet that reduces glucose spikes can decrease inflammation and the risk of inflammatory diseases.

**Establishing a baseline with Hemoglobin A1c**

Red blood cells (RBCs) are constantly being produced, used, and cycled out of the body. RBCs survive in the blood for approximately two to three months, so this test shows the average glucose level in your blood during the most recent two to three months. If your glucose levels have been high, your HbA1c test will be higher. One test cannot make a clear diagnosis because of how often your hemoglobin circulates out of the bloodstream. Therefore, knowing your baseline and comparing your levels over time is important in tracking overall health.

People with diabetes should take this test every three months to make sure their blood sugar is in their target range. After that, the frequency of taking this test depends on the type of diabetes, blood sugar control, and treatment plans.

### Leptin

| Optimal range      |
| ------------------ |
| 0.30 - 13.40 ng/mL |

Leptin is a protein hormone created by fat cells that helps regulate your appetite. Its main jobs are managing energy expenditure and telling your brain to stop eating.

Here's how it works: at a healthy weight, fat cells produce leptin, which triggers the hypothalamus in the brain to regulate your appetite. Generally, the amount of leptin in your blood is related to the amount of fat tissue in your body. If you have excess fat, leptin will rise. Conversely, if you are very lean, leptin stores will decrease. There’s a Georgian word _shemomedjamo_ that describes someone who knows when they are full but continues to eat anyway. That “knowing” is your leptin telling you when you’re done.

Unfortunately, leptin is a proinflammatory molecule, which contributes to chronic inflammation when released in excess for people living with obesity. So, when anti-inflammatory adiponectin and pro-inflammatory leptin are out of balance the result can be chronic inflammation. When an individual has excess fat, a high level of leptin in the blood may lower the body's sensitivity to leptin and cause leptin resistance, which in turn may lead to overeating.

Leptin resistance and insulin resistance have many similar causes. Anything that causes inflammation (stress, poor diet, food sensitivities, leaky gut, environmental toxins) may trigger leptin to go up. Leptin has now been identified as a critical hormone for reproduction as well and has its own ability, beyond insulin, to reduce blood sugar in tissues.

### Adiponectin

| Optimal range      |
| ------------------ |
| 2.50 - 12.30 ug/mL |

Adiponectin is a protein hormone (growth hormone, like prolactin and insulin) that influences body weight and metabolism. It helps to combat inflammation, regulate glucose, metabolize lipids, and control insulin response. Adiponectin is also secreted from fat cells, like leptin, but has an anti-inflammatory effect on its target cells and is of concern when low, not high; the opposite of leptin. Adiponectin is emerging as a fertility biomarker and plays a role in the hormones produced in the ovary, egg development within a follicle, and even implantation of an embryo into the uterine lining.

In order to fully understand adiponectin, it’s important to know how proteins help with metabolic functions, which change food into energy. This energy helps our body do everything from getting out of bed in the morning, moving, thinking, and growing. Proteins like adiponectin help control the chemical reactions of metabolism.

Adiponectin belongs to the family of proteins called adipokines, meaning it is secreted from adipocytes, which are fat cells. It is also a hormonal messenger and communicates specific signals to neighboring and far away cells. It helps to support the metabolic functions in the body including insulin sensitization, protection against atherosclerosis, hypertension, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, among others.

Good food is the number one supporter of adiponectin. When your meals are on track and you’re getting enough proteins, healthy fats, vitamins and minerals, it’s easier for your body to do the above tasks. With this in mind, think about this test as an indicator of metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes. When low, it will slow you down because there aren’t enough proteins to help with metabolic functions.

### Insulin

| Optimal range |
| ------------- |
| 2 - 5 uIU/mL  |

Insulin is a protein hormone that helps glucose enter cells. Glucose is a sugar derived from carbohydrates (starchy vegetables, fruits, grains) that acts as your body's main source of energy.

When you eat a carbohydrate, your body breaks it down into glucose where it is absorbed through the intestines before entering the bloodstream. During this process, glucose levels in the blood naturally rise, which signals the pancreas to make insulin. From there, insulin guides glucose into cells. Think of insulin as a doorman for glucose. Without the doorman, glucose gets stuck in the hallway unable to enter the cell.

- **Type 1 diabetes:** there is too little insulin and blood sugar is too high (hyperglycemia), which means cells can't get the energy they need. This could indicate inadequate production of insulin from the pancreas. This is the basis of type 1 diabetes.
- **Type 2 diabetes or prediabetes:** Most commonly, blood sugar is too high (or high-normal) and insulin is also high or high-normal. This is **insulin resistance**, meaning it is taking more and more insulin to pull the same amount of blood sugar from the blood. This is the case with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.
- **Insulinoma**: there is too much insulin and blood sugar is too low (hypoglycemia), causing symptoms such as sweating, trembling, and lightheadedness. This should be evaluated for an insulinoma (insulin-secreting tumor of the pancreas).

Establishing your baseline by testing your insulin over time is incredibly insightful to how your health, habits, and lifestyle affect your levels. Testing your insulin can help uncover the reasons behind abnormal blood sugar, insulin resistance, and other conditions related to insulin production. It can also reveal hidden problems with how your body controls your blood sugar years before escalating to more serious issues, such as diabetes.

Because you fasted for this test, your numbers reflect your “fasted insulin.” If your numbers are abnormal, it may be beneficial to get a continuous glucose monitor to track your blood sugar throughout the day. Insulin fluctuates with food, drink, and activity, so while “fasted insulin” can signal abnormal levels, monitoring like this also offers an important reading.

### Glucose

| Optimal range | Reference range |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 70 - 85 mg/dL | 65-99 mg/dL     |

Glucose is a type of sugar your body uses for energy. When you eat starch, table or fruit sugars, they are broken down into glucose. Once glucose is absorbed it travels throughout the body where it either becomes the energy molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP)—the storage form in the liver or muscle tissue glycogen—or is made into energy storage molecules called triglycerides, which are the fat storage form of carbohydrates.

- **Too little glucose:** blood sugar is too low (hypoglycemia). Symptoms include excessive sweating and hunger, lightheadedness, fatigue, nausea, confusion, headache, and shakiness
- **Too much glucose:** blood sugar is too high (hyperglycemia) and cells can't get the energy they need. Diabetes can cause high glucose. Symptoms include frequent urination, excessive thirst, blurry vision, fatigue, headache, and risk for ketoacidosis in extreme cases.

The human body is very intuitive and maintains a somewhat narrow range for blood glucose. When there’s excess, it releases insulin to pull blood sugar out of the blood. When deficient, it releases glucagon to reduce risk of hypoglycemic events. Hence it is relatively difficult, except in cases of diabetes or extreme fasting, to experience symptoms from too high or too low blood sugar. With that being said, the more common form of abnormal glucose values is something called “impaired fasting glucose” caused by prediabetes or other issues with metabolism. Almost always asymptomatic, this is when glucose levels are between 95-125 consistently when fasting. They also should be correlated with elevated fasting insulin, abnormal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), higher HbA1c, and increased triglyceride to HDL ratio.

It’s important to understand that by the time your blood sugar (glucose) is elevated, you’re already a few steps into a potentially negative path. Healthy, body-affirming foods are absolutely critical in the maintenance of your glucose and reduction of spikes. Jessie Inchauspé, author of _Glucose Revolution,_ has also used science to better understand how and when you eat food matters. This means _you_ can, through lifestyle adjustments, stay on a healthy course and/or shift the tide of unhealthy glucose levels.

To avoid hypo- or hyper- glycemia, maintain a healthy lifestyle and exercise. Stable blood sugar brings fulfillment to your mood, energy, and focus. Hyperglycemia, in particular, is a major driver of many diseases and illnesses: cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart attacks, kidney disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. Too much can also cause unpleasant moods, anxiety, and feelings of depression.

### Uric Acid

| Optimal range   | Reference range |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| 3.8 - 5.0 mg/dL | 4.0 - 8.0 mg/dL |

When your body digests purines—a compound found in some foods and drinks (beer, high-fat dairy and meat, and organ meats)—it produces a waste compound called uric acid. At healthy levels, uric acid helps enzymes and hormones, and also aids processes like antioxidant activity and stress, and regulating blood pressure. Once it’s utilized, it dissolves in the blood and is filtered mostly by the kidneys. However, some go through the intestines. From there, it leaves the body through urine or stools.

At unhealthy levels, either high or low, uric acid can cause problems. If too much uric acid is produced, then the kidneys can’t remove it properly and levels in the blood increase. A buildup of uric acid causes crystals and potential kidney stones, but it can also lead to a type of arthritis known as gout.

Testing uric acid in the blood screens for most purine metabolic disorders, like gout, anemia, and immunodeficiencies.

## Urine

### pH

| Optimal range  | Reference range |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| 6.50 - 7.50 pH | 5.0 - 8.0 pH    |

Urine is composed of metabolites that the body has designated as a waste product. Urine also contains nutrients, electrolytes, and water, all of which impact pH balance. The acidity of your urine can change when the balance of those compounds changes, and a pH urine test reveals their composition.

- Low pH: urine becomes more acidic when the body retains excess sodium or acid. Common factors of this include:
  - Diet high in fish, meat products, or cheese
  - Diabetic ketoacidosis, which is a complication of diabetes
  - Diarrhea or vomiting
  - Starvation
- High pH: when your body retains excess “base,” your urine becomes more basic or “alkaline.” Common factors of this, include:
  - Diet high in fruits, vegetables, or non-dairy cheese or milk products
  - Kidney stones
  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs)
  - Kidney related disorders

The goal of testing pH is to identify whether or not you have an acid-base imbalance, to determine how severe the imbalance is, and to help diagnose underlying diseases or conditions (such as diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening complication of diabetes). Testing also helps monitor critical illnesses that affect acid-base balance, such as chronic lung disease and kidney disease.

### Specific Gravity

| Optimal range  | Reference range  |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| 1.00 - 1.04 SG | 1.001 - 1.035 SG |

Specific Gravity tests the concentration of particles in your urine, and is a quick way for a physician to tell if your kidneys are trying to compensate for an abnormality.

- Too concentrated: Most commonly associated with dehydration. This may also be a sign of kidney dysfunction but should be correlated with creatinine in the blood.
- Under concentrated: This may signal a rare condition called diabetes insipidus, which causes thirst and the excretion of large amounts of diluted urine

### Glucose

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| Negative        |

If you’re healthy, glucose levels in your urine are generally too low to be detected. However, after very high sugar meals (Thanksgiving or that dinner party you attended before your test) it is not uncommon to temporarily see glucose in your urine. If you properly fasted and your test detects glucose, closely review your blood glucose and HbA1c tests.

According to the University of California San Francisco, almost 50% of pregnant women detect glucose in their urine at some point during their pregnancy

### Protein

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| Negative        |

Normally, protein stays in your blood and doesn’t pass into your urine. Your kidneys prevent this from happening through proper filtering channels. There are things called glomeruli (loops of capillaries) that allow only small particles, like salt, water, and waste into your urine while keeping the larger particles like protein at bay. When this process isn’t working and protein gets into your urine it is a sign that the glomeruli are inflamed or damaged.

The goal of this test is to evaluate kidney function. If proteinuria (protein in urine) is detected, you should monitor this regularly over time to see if it resolves or becomes worse. Both urine and blood tests evaluate proteinuria.

### Bilirubin

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| Negative        |

The liver makes bile to help you digest food. This bile contains bilirubin. Most bilirubin comes from the body's normal process of breaking down old red blood cells. A healthy liver can normally get rid of excess bilirubin, but when the liver isn’t working properly it can cause buildup of bilirubin.

Healthy urine and livers won’t have bilirubin, but high bilirubin levels can mean a problem with your liver.

### Ketone

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| Negative        |

Ketones are produced in the liver and are part of your body’s metabolism process. They are formed from the breakdown of fatty acids into a compound called _acetyl CoA_, which is then converted in the liver and exported to tissues as a fuel source. They are formed when there’s not enough glucose or sugar to fuel your body’s energy stores. If you’re low on blood glucose, your body is able to increase the production of these energy-rich compounds to provide fuel to keep going. This usually happens when or if you’re fasting, restricting calories, or on a ketogenic or low carb diet. It can also occur in someone with untreated or uncontrolled diabetes. Most commonly, type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Ketones can show up in both your blood and urine. High levels \*\*\*\*in urine may indicate ketoacidosis or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a complication of diabetes; the latter can lead to a coma or even death. If you do not have diabetes, there are other factors that can cause the development of ketones:

- Chronic vomiting and/or diarrhea, or eating disorders
- Gastrointestinal diseases (IBS, Colitis, Crohn’s, Celiac, GERD)
- Strenuous exercise
- Very low-carbohydrate diet
- Fasting
- Pregnancy

### Nitrite

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| Negative        |

Healthy urine has chemicals called nitrates. If bacteria enter the urinary tract, nitrates can transform into a chemical called nitrites. Increased nitrites in urine, therefore, may be a sign of an infection in the urinary tract, which includes the kidneys, renal pelvis, ureters, bladder, and urethra. This is known as a urinary tract infection (UTI). Sometimes, however, not all bacteria is able to convert nitrate to nitrite, so it is possible to have a UTI even with a negative nitrite test.

### Leukocytes

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| Negative        |

Leukocytes are white blood cells (WBCs) and if they’re detected in your urine, it may be a sign of inflammation in the urinary tract or kidneys, which causes WBCs to go to the urinary tract to help fight the problem. The most common cause for WBCs in urine, a condition called leukocyturia, is a bacterial infection in the bladder or kidney.

When this test is positive and/or the WBC count in urine is high, it may indicate that there is inflammation in the urinary tract or kidneys. Typically, a doctor will look under a microscope at the WBCs and other signs that point to an infection.

### Occult Blood

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| Negative        |

This test detects blood in your urine, otherwise medically referred to as hematuria. Although blood in the urine can feel alarming, it is not necessarily a cause for great alarm. Blood in the urine is a sign, not a disease itself. Occult blood should prompt you into looking for an underlying cause.

When your urine is tinted red or light pink, it could be from laxatives, beets, rhubarb, berries, riboflavin, and B12. This typically clears up after a few days. Blood in your urine, however, looks different and you might even feel pain in your kidneys or after peeing.

### Clarity / Appearance

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| Clear           |

A clarity test is what it sounds like; checking in on the clarity of your urine from clear to turbid. Here are the types of clarity and what they could potentially mean:

- Clear: overhydrated
- Slightly clear: just right
- Cloudy: dehydration, UTI, kidney stones, blood, crystals, yeast, parasites
- Excessively cloudy (turbid): detected protein or cellular material

### Color

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| Yellow          |

An unusual urine color can be a sign of disease or dehydration. The scale of light to dark gives a picture of how much water is being flushed through your system. You can visibly check on your hydration by looking at the color of your urine. Fluids dilute the yellow pigments in urine, so the more you drink, the clearer your urine. As with occult blood, other things can impact the color of your urine, too: water intake, vitamins, laxatives, beets, rhubarb, and other deeply tinted foods.

If your urine is consistently discolored, the color test can help screen for and/or monitor several diseases and conditions, such as kidney disorders or urinary tract infections (UTIs).

### Bacteria

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| None Seen       |

Healthy urine is sterile, meaning absence of microbes like bacteria and yeast, so when there is bacteria in your urine, you may have an infection, especially if you experience symptoms, such as pain after urination, lower or upper back pain, or blood in your urine. This test is typically used to diagnose a urinary tract infection (UTI).

### Hyaline Casts

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| None Seen       |

Hyaline casts are the only casts that can be present in healthy urine. In which case, you may experience slow urine flow, which can be a result of strenuous exercise, diuretic medications, severe vomiting, or fever. Large amounts of hyaline casts may indicate kidney damage due to decreased blood flow to the kidneys.

### Squamous Epithelial Cells

| Reference range |
| --------------- |
| None Seen       |

The squamous epithelial cells are composed of the type of epithelial cell that is most common to the skin, blood vessels, and lower part of the urethra or genital tract. It's normal to have a small amount of epithelial cells in your urine. A larger amount may suggest contamination from the genital tract, kidney disease, or another serious medical condition.

## Biometrics

### Blood Pressure

Blood pressure is measured using two numbers:

- Systolic: measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart contracts and pushes blood into the body.
- Diastolic: measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart relaxes/fills with blood between beats.

If the measurement reads 120 systolic and 80 diastolic, you would say, “120 over 80.” Risk increases as the numbers increase. High blood pressure (hypertension) means that the pressure in your arteries doesn’t allow for complete filling or relaxation of the heart as well as increased shearing forces on the artery walls. Blood pressure changes throughout the day depending on your activity, eating large meals, or even stress level. But prolonged blood pressure caused by smoking, obesity, and chronic stress can cause your arteries to become less flexible over time. This leads to a decreased ability to dilate the blood vessels and provide oxygenation to the tissues. Over time this can lead to serious, life-threatening medical conditions.

**Normal**

- Systolic: between 90 - 120 mm Hg
- Diastolic: less than 80 mm Hg

**At Risk (prehypertension)**

- Systolic: 120–139 mm Hg
- Diastolic: 80–89 mm Hg

**High Blood Pressure (hypertension)**

- Systolic: 140 mm Hg or higher
- Diastolic: 90 mm Hg or higher

When high blood pressure leads to hypertension, it may require medical care and cause:

- Early morning headaches
- Nosebleeds
- Irregular heart rhythms
- Changes in vision changes
- Buzzing in the ears
- Fatigue
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Confusion
- Anxiety
- Chest pain
- Muscle tremors.

In order to maintain healthy blood pressure levels, it’s important to be at a healthy weight. Blood pressure is related to lifestyle, weight, and food choices. Exercising 90-150 minutes a week (That’s nothing! There are 10,000 minutes in a week!), supports your overall health and keeps a good flow in your veins.

### Weight

Maintaining a healthy weight is important for every human’s overall health. Looking through the complex and miraculous systems constantly at work to help us thrive, it’s our duty to help and support them. Being over or underweight can throw off the synergy of cells, catapult inflammation, and hinder every mechanism of your body. Take a meander through the biomarkers you’ve tested and reflect on how food, exercise, and excess fat can then impact those biomarkers. Also, consider the impact of malnourishment by being underweight. It’s truly extraordinary.

Good health and proper weight helps to prevent, control, and even heal many diseases and conditions. Being on the high or low spectrum of weight impacts almost every aspect of health, from reproductive and respiratory function to memory and mood.

Excess weight puts you at higher risk of developing serious health problems, including heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, gallstones, breathing problems, and certain cancers. Weighing too little can contribute to malnutrition, and therefore a weakened immune system, fragile bones, and chronic fatigue.

When your body is nourished with the vitamins, minerals, and nutrients it needs, the complex and magical workings are able to work in symphony. Maintaining weight is taking care of the beautiful machine churning inside of you. It’s fueling it with energy and creating a wonderful flow of cells that enhance your everyday health.

### Height

Your height is being used to calculate body mass index (BMI), along with weight and waist circumference.

### Waist Circumference

Your waist circumference is the measurement of your waistline. Excess fat around the abdomen (or abdominal fat mass) is associated with an increased risk of cardiometabolic disease and most chronic illnesses. While your WC isn’t a diagnostic tool on its own, it is a marker of your risk based on fat mass. Men and women who have waist circumferences greater than 40 inches (102 cm) and 35 inches (88 cm), respectively, are considered to be at risk for illness.

This helps calculate body mass index (BMI). However, BMI is not accurate for everyone because you can have a high BMI if you are a bodybuilder or have tons of muscle, which doesn’t make you “obese.”

### Body Mass Index (BMI, calculated)

Body Mass Index (BMI) is often looked at to measure obesity. However, BMI is not accurate for everyone as it doesn’t take into account body composition. An example is that of a bodybuilder. They may have tons of muscle, and because of that, they have a high BMI. However, they are technically not “obese.” So, according to BMI measurements, a bodybuilder has low body fat but can have a BMI in the obese range and a skinny fat person can have a normal BMI but have the body fat of an obese person.

Therefore, BMI isn’t always the best tool to assess general health. To normalize this factor, waist-to-hip ratio is also considered. For males, the ideal waist-to-hip ratio is < 0.9 and for females, the ideal waist-to-hip ratio is < 0.8.

BMI is used in some biomarkers, such as leptin or adiponectin, to determine the reference range. For example, based on the BMI of adults, they are in or out of range for leptin.

## Food Allergy

### Adult Food Allergy Profile (IgE)

There are a couple of things to understand about this test. First, an IgE (also known as immunoglobulin) is an antibody that is made in response to an allergen.  It is part of the signaling system that triggers histamine release from a cell type called a mast cell.

There are four major types of immunoglobulin antibodies: IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE. The body produces different antibodies to attack different things. As an example, one antibody is used to fight off the flu, while another will activate and release histamines to combat an allergy. The IgE allergy test looks if you are susceptible to the classic, well-known list of food allergies. An important thing to note here is that IgE food allergies are different from food sensitivities, which are mediated by IgG, IgM, and IgA immunoglobulins.

If the results show that you have an IgE-mediated food allergy, the treatment is to avoid the food. There is no proven cure for food allergies except for eliminating the food to prevent allergic reactions or seeing an allergist for desensitization therapy.

### **Food Allergy (IgE - mediated by the immune system)**

When triggered by something your body sees as dangerous—pollen, dander, dust mites, or in the case of food, a protein—the immune system’s IgE antibodies release histamines. Allergy foods cause an immediate IgE response after exposure. For instance, hives, wheezing, difficulty breathing, or anaphylactic shock. Eight foods are responsible for most food allergies:

- Peanuts
- Tree nuts
- Dairy
- Eggs
- Gluten
- Soy
- Fish
- Shellfish

### Shellfish Allergy Panel (IgE)

Shellfish allergies are the most common food allergy in adults, and about 60% of people allergic to shellfish experience their first reaction during adulthood. This blood test measures your IgE antibody response to shellfish proteins by measuring the amount of IgE antibodies in your bloodstream.

Shellfish includes:

- Crustaceans: lobster, shrimp, crab, krill, prawns
- Mollusks: mussels, clams, oysters, scallops
- Note: finned fish can have cross-contamination when being prepared

Many people allergic to shellfish have severe reactions, like anaphylactic shock, which immediately triggers swollen throat (airway constriction), rapid pulse, shock, or dizziness or lightheadedness. This is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment with an epinephrine (EpiPen) injection and/or a trip to the emergency room.

Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening, and if you have a shellfish allergy, risk of anaphylaxis increases if have:

- Asthma
- Allergic reactions to very small amounts of shellfish (extreme sensitivity)
- A history of food-induced anaphylaxis

## Alzheimer's Risk

### Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)

ApoE is a genetic test that comes in three major types (alleles): 2, 3, 4. We all inherit two copies, one from each parent, therefore it is possible to have a combination of different numbers together. For instance, ApoE2/3 or ApoE3/4. One of its important jobs is cholesterol metabolism. If your cholesterol is high, double check your ApoE status as this may be an important contributing factor.

- ApoE3 is the most common version. It neither increases nor decreases the risk of Alzheimer’s Disease.
- ApoE2 is the most effective ApoE at supporting healthy brain metabolism and reducing the brain’s production of plaques and fibrillary tangles (from another protein, tau, that seems to play a role).
- ApoE4 is considered potentially problematic due to the reduced efficiency of lipid metabolism in the brain and the impact it seems to have on carriers for Alzheimer's risk. ApoE4 creates more challenges to remove cholesterol and other waste products from the brain's helper cells, so the brain creates more plaque and fibrillary tangles in response. Unfortunately, in people who have this gene but choose to smoke, not control their blood sugar, and are metabolically “unfit,” these harmful, disease-causing plaques are able to build up and damage the brain and the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

ApoE is a predictive genetic biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease, currently one of the leading causes of death in the United States. The result of this test illuminates your personal risk, even decades before onset of the disease. Holding this wisdom in your hands, along with the health of your brain's support systems, can potentially help you avert onset completely.

For many people, Alzheimer’s can be avoided. In fact, according to Dr. Dale Bredesen, one of the leading pioneers of Alzheimer’s research, believes the disease is preventable. “We can now say if someone’s risk for Alzheimer's is significant, preventative care can reduce that risk to virtually zero. My argument is, with what we know now, virtually no one should get Alzheimer's. It is now essentially an optional illness.”

ApoE is a gene that influences the amount of harmful plaque in your brain (as well as many other factors, such as inflammation and fat absorption), which are thought to be one of the main features of Alzheimer’s. The type of ApoE you carry determines your risk for developing the disease.

# **How is it measured?**

While possessing one or both copies is shown to increase the risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's, it is not a diagnosis. Once you understand your personal ApoE, you can be empowered to take steps to reduce your risk of a future diagnosis. Here’s a breakdown of the ApoE ranges as reflected in Function results:

- **ApoE2 and ApoE3**. The lifetime risk associated with these genes is usually caused by exposure to toxins, head trauma, vascular disease, and sometimes, atrophy. Meaning that the body’s support systems are weak and cannot bring life-affirming support to the brain. Typically, this occurs with chronically low vitamin D, estradiol, testosterone, and thyroid function. The following markers (which are ApoE4-negative) have risk levels lower than 9%.
  - **ApoE2/2**
  - **ApoE2/3**
  - **ApoE3/3**
- **ApoE4:** The most common risk factor gene for Alzheimer’s. Developing Alzheimer’s with the ApoE4 gene is influenced by inflammation from diet, exposure to toxins, and behaviors decades before symptoms first express themselves. Meaning, you can learn about your risk 10 to 15 years before onset and reduce your risk (and potentially avoid it completely) by proactively managing your personal risk factors.
  - **ApoE2/4**: lifetime risk is less than 30%
  - **ApoE3/4:** 75 million Americans with lifetime risk is 30%
  - **ApoE4/4:** 7 million Americans with lifetime risk is 50% - 90%

And while ApoE4 is most known for its association with Alzheimer’s, it is also linked to other forms of dementia and cognitive decline, high cholesterol, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease susceptibility, and gallstones. If you have this gene, it is a signal, not a diagnosis. Most importantly (and incredibly empowering) is that you can do something about it.

# **Why ApoE4?**

ApoE4 is believed to be partly responsible for damaging the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is built to protect the brain from outside threats. Once the BBB is compromised, cognitive diseases are more apt to occur from sources like exposure to inflammation, toxins, and bacteria. This becomes especially problematic when those threats are chronic, ongoing, and unrelenting. Knowing your risk factors can be the defining knowledge of preventing your onset. The following are the most common factors:

- Inflammation from infection, diet, diabetes, high blood pressure
  - Biomarkers: white blood cell, red blood cell, hemoglobin, HbA1c, hsCRP, triglyceride/HDL ratio, LDL particle number, insulin, blood pressure
- The decline of support systems: nutrients, hormones, and other brain-affirming molecules
  - Biomarkers: Vitamin D, MMA, Omega, estradiol, testosterone, thyroid function (TSH, T3, T4, TgAb, iodine)
- Toxic substances such as metals or biotoxins (poisons produced by microbes such as mold)
  - Biomarkers: mercury, aluminum, lead, arsenic, nickel
- Glucotoxicity, diabetes, insulin resistance
  - Biomarkers: glucose, insulin
- Urinary mycotoxins
  - Additional testing: mold
- Brain trauma, injury, or infection
  - Examples: stroke, head trauma
- Calcium spore

# **Prevention**

Empowering your brain’s support systems is key to reducing your personal risk. You’ll want to look at your metabolic, gut, and cardiac health, vital nutrients, hormones, and inflammation status, and exposure to toxins and metals. Keeping track of these systems will guide you down a path specific to your body and brain: whether that’s detoxing the presence of metals, strengthening your gut with supportive foods and good bacteria, or avoiding exposure to toxins in your household, to name just a few.

Dr. Bredesen, Dr. Hyman, and many others in the field of lipidology believe there is a tremendous amount of preventative action every person can take for better health, especially strategic prevention for dietary, gut, and cardiac health, along with toxin exposure and avoidance.

Dr. Bredesen believes that once you know your Alzheimer’s risk, “there's a tremendous amount that can be done to live appropriately to your status.”

- Minimize inflammation from stress, food, and toxins
- Stabilize supportive nutrients, hormones, and other brain-strengthening molecules
- Detox or avoid toxic substances such as metals, biotoxins, chemicals
- Regulate glucose
- Check for mold in your home

**Self Care**

Individuals with the ApoE4 gene can reduce their risk by engaging in activities and lifestyles that empower the brain and reduce your risk.

- Sleep
- Exercise
- Stress reduction
- Healthy nutrition
- Meaningful relationships with yourself and others

**What to eat**

In general, the brain needs fuel from vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats (it is, after all, made up of 60% fat). When diverting your path from a disease like Alzheimer’s, it’s important to not only engage in brain health but also the health of its supporting systems. Since ApoE4 is linked to cardiac health, blood pressure, diabetes, and more inflammatory conditions taking care to avoid inflammation in the first place can help mitigate risk. Below are suggested foods that provide a wide array of the nutrients your brain/body needs, along with gut support to ensure your microbiome is properly nourished.

- Non-starchy vegetables: arugula, asparagus, bean sprouts, broccoli, bok choy, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, collard greens, kale, cucumber, eggplant, green tops of beets, dandelion, mustard, and turnips, green beans, fennel, hearts of palm, leafy lettuces (except iceberg), jicama, kohlrabi, leeks, mushrooms, okra, onions, bell peppers, zucchini and summer squash, tomatoes, swiss chard, snow peas, snap peas, spinach, radish, rutabaga, watercress, garlic, ginger, onions, parsley
- Starchy vegetables (limited quantities): carrots, corn, green peas, sweet potatoes, yams, parsnips, taro, cassava, winter squash (butternut, acorn, kabocha, pumpkin), plantains, beets, turnips, rutabaga, artichoke
- Fruits: avocados, apples, pears, peaches, bananas, mangoes, papayas, berries (blueberry, blackberry, raspberry, strawberry, cranberry, elderberry, boysenberry, currants, acai, goji)
- Whole, gluten-free grains: quinoa, buckwheat, whole-kernel rye, amaranth, millet, teff, sorghum, black rice, brown rice, red rice, wild rice (actually a seed)

- Refined starches: white flour, white rice, pasta, flour tortillas, corn grits, ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, and other products made from processed white flour
- Refined sugars and sweeteners: refined white sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, artificial sweeteners (aspartame, sucralose, saccharin acesulfame potassium), high-fructose corn syrup, agave, brown rice syrup, evaporated cane juice
- Refined oils and spreads: soybean, canola, corn, safflower, sunflower, palm, peanut, vegetable, vegetable shortening, margarine, and anything that says “hydrogenated”
- Dairy: milk, cheese, ice cream, yogurt

## Hormone

### Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1)

| Optimal range   | Reference range |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| 133 - 430 ng/dL | 53 - 331 ng/mL  |

This test evaluates your Growth Hormone, which is made by the pituitary gland and triggers the liver to produce IGF-1. IGF-1 stimulates cell development throughout the body, leading to growth, strengthening of tissues, healing, and other systems. Typically, IGF-1 levels depend on age as IGF-1 naturally decreases as you get older. The biomarker is often compared with testosterone to determine anti-aging strategies.
