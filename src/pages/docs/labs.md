## Peter Attia's top five lab tests:

- Lp(a)-P (or Lp[a] mass is a reasonable approximation).

- APOE genotype.

- LDL-P (or ApoB).

- OGTT with insulin measurements.

- ALT

Honorable mentions: Hcy, hs-CRP, oxLDL, and oxPL, fibrinogen, Lp-PLA2, ADMA and SDMA are also really helpful to know. Estradiol (E2) as well. Knowing your family history can also tell you something about risk.
