The goal of nutrition is to optimize metabolic health.

We should focus on consuming enough protein and fiber while avoiding hyper-processed foods, vegetable oils, and added sugars.

## Nutritional Framework

There are 3 "levers" we can pull in terms of nutrition:

- Dietary restriction - restricting **what** you eat
- Time restriction - restricting **when** you eat
- Calorie restriction - restricting **how much** you eat

For optimal metabolic health, try to keep average blood glucose less than 100 milligrams per deciliter, standard deviation less than 15 milligrams per deciliter, and avoid spikes over 140 milligrams per deciliter.

An excellent way to track metabolic health is with a continuous glucose monitor. [Levels](https://levelshealth.com) helps you see how food affects your health with personalized insights so you can optimize your nutrition and activity.
