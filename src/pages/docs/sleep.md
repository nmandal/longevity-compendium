Sleep is the foundation of health.
Good sleep is critical to our innate physiological repair processes, while poor sleep triggers a cascade of negative downstream consequences, from insulin resistance to cognitive decline, as well as mental health issues.

[Four pillars of sleep](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/four-pillars-of-sleep-depth-duration-continuity-and-regularity): depth, duration, continuity, and regularity.

Depth/quality: deep sleep and ossilations

Duration: getting enough time of sleep

Continuity: minimizing wake-ups and fragmentation

Regularity: Going to bed and waking up at the same time each day.

Sleep hygiene protocol:

- Regularity: go to bed and wake up at the same time each day
- Darkness at night and daylight at the beginning of the day
- Temperature - get cool
- Don't stay in bed awake
- Avoid caffeine in the afternoon and alcohol in the evening
- Wind-down routine: stretch, meditate, gadget-free, etc.

The test for determining your sleep chronotype: [Automated Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire](https://chronotype-self-test.info/index.php?sid=61524&newtest=Y)

The [Oura ring](https://ouraring.com) is a great tool to track sleep and associated biomarkers.
