We're decentralizing longevity.

EARLY has four key components: the [software platform](https://earlydao.vercel.app), the [community-driven podcast](https://decentralizinglongevity.vercel.app), a [longevity compendium](https://longevitydocs.vercel.app), and short-form video content.

With these four pieces, EARLY lends itself to many different kinds of contributors: software engineers to build the platform, researchers for the compendium, creators for short-form video, and practitioners to use the platform to track key longevity metrics as well as reflect on their performance (anonymized with wallet authentication). All contributors are incentivized with $EARLY governance tokens and dictate the roadmap and direction of the DAO.
