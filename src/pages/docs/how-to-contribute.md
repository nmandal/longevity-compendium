We're decentralizing longevity.

EARLY has four key components: the software platform, the community-driven podcast, a longevity compendium, and short-form video content.

With these four pieces, EARLY lends itself to many different kinds of contributors: software engineers to build the platform, researchers for the compendium, creators for short-form video, and practitioners to use the platform to track their health (anonymized with wallet authentication). All contributors are incentivized with governance tokens and dictate the roadmap and direction of the DAO.
