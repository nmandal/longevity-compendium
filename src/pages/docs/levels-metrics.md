EARLY leverages [Levels](https://www.levelshealth.com) for logging meals. Levels provides real-time feedback on how your diet and lifestyle choices impact your metabolic health using continuous glucose monitors (CGM). Their app provides a great interface for tracking meals even if a CGM isn't equipped.

## Metrics the EARLY platform collects from Levels

- Local time
- Type
- Notes
- Photo link (optional)

In a perfect world, we would also collect data on the calories and macros of what we eat as well as our body's glucose response to the meal.

## Exporting your Levels data
