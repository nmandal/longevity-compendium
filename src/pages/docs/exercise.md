The framework for exercise is built upon four pillars: stability, strength, aerobic efficiency, and anaerobic performance.

We want to be able to perform [activities of daily living](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living) independently when we are at an old age.

## Stability

Stability is truly the cornerstone upon which your strength, your aerobic performance, and your anaerobic performance relies. And when it comes to working on any of the other pillars, stability is critical for doing so safely.

## Strength

Strength means utilizing muscle to generate force. And if you are interested in living a long and healthy life and playing with your great-grandkids someday, then muscle mass should be a priority.

## Aerobic Performance

Aerobic performance or zone 2 is defined as the highest metabolic output/work that you can sustain while keeping your lactate level below two millimole per liter. This is the highest level of exertion that is effectively pure mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation before you start to net accumulate lactate.

## Anaerobic Output

Anaerobic output or zone 5 training focuses on improving VO2 max.

## Exercise Routine

A typical week of exercise consists of:

- 3-5 bouts of strength training
- 4 bouts of zone 2
- 2 bouts of zone 5
- Stability is sprinkled into pretty much every day with maybe one day of a longer, more dedicated 60-minute session around stability

An example schedule looks as follows:

- Cardio days‒ Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday

  - 45 minutes of zone 2 training on Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday
  - Saturday is a zone 2 workout (45”) followed by zone 5 workout (30”)

- Weightlifting‒ Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday

  - Lower body on Mondays and Fridays, and does upper body on Wednesdays and Sundays
