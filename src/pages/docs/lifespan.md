Increasing lifespan boils down to delaying the inevitability of death.
The four most common disease processes that end life are:

- Atherosclerotic disease (comprised of cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease)
- Cancer
- Neurodegenerative disease (Alzheimer’s disease being the most common)
- “Foundational disease” - a spectrum of everything from hyperinsulinemia to insulin resistance to fatty liver disease to type 2 diabetes.
