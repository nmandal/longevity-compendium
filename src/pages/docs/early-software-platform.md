EARLY is about being a longevity practitioner instead of an enthusiast.

The EARLY software platform integrates with exceptional data aggregators such as Apple Health, Oura, and Levels to make it easy to sync your exercise, sleep, and nutrition data.

With that data, the platform can provide insightful, data-driven, actionable analytics as well as visualizations for key longevity metrics.

Wearables aren't so great at saying what your data means based on your age, sex, context, and history. With this information, the platform can find out what the data means, give you suggestions on how to change it, then once we know what to change and are starting to change it, we can run real-life experiments at an individual level and can create persoanlized plan with what's working, what's not, and find a sweet spot for perfection.
